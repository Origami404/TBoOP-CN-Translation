    This book has been a labor of love and an obsession that has occupied more than ten years of my life. I would like to thank Christopher Warnock for being a major cheerleader in this project and helping get this ball rolling in its initial stages. For the many people who have taken my questions, put up with my months of solitude, listened, and supported me, I’d like to thank Jeff Purdue, Janelle Clark, Marcus McCoy, Catamara Rosarium, Stian Kulystin, Tai Fenix Kulystin, Jenn Zahrt, Joel Hutchinson, Ruth Hutchinson, Austin Coppock, Kaitlin Coppock, Maria Miles, and Thomas Brown. This book couldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for a community, and if I’ve left anyone out, I apologize.

    I make special mention of Odun de Arechaga, my deceased mentor, padrino, and friend, who introduced me to Agrippa and #emph[The Picatrix] at a time when there was little material on astrological magic and fewer specialists of this art. Now, thirty years later, I still haven’t found the end to the rabbit hole he introduced me to.

    Publisher’s Preface
  ]
  #p_normal[
    All philosophy has been revealed. It is a construction of the mind. Ideas that are made up of words are deconstructed in an effort to divine meaning. Science has subsumed philosophy as the virtuous pursuit of knowledge. Modern science needs empirical evidence, a quantity to be measured, and a conviction that those measurements will yield the true nature of reality. These are the beliefs of those who worship in the church of progress. They cannot conceive of an occult philosophy. Yet, after nearly four hundred years, #emph[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]
    have been newly translated into English for the first time. Why?
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Today, as in the past, the magician requires access to the three worlds in order to collect their virtues. Professer Agrippa asks in his opening note to the reader:
  ]
  #p_quote[
    If they avert evil events, destroy black magic, cure disease, banish spirits, preserve life, and give honor and fortune without offense to God or injury to religion, are not these things useful and necessary to men?
  ]
  #p_normal[
    We, the descendants of Agrippa, answer through the centuries with a resounding “Yes!” This wise and learned savant knew that we would be enriched by the ideas contained in his #emph[Three Books].
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Agrippa’s library contained the texts that offered the accumulated wisdom of the ancients. Along with books from the Classical, Medieval, and Renaissance periods, Agrippa drew upon the traditions of the ancient Hebrews, Persians, and Indians to synthesize and present his occult philosophy. These three books have sustained the occult tradition for centuries and are responsible for its revival in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. No other work in the Western tradition has had a greater influence on our understanding of the occult mysteries.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    In his letter to Trithemius upon the presentation of his 1510 manuscript of #emph[The Occult Philosophy,] Agrippa stated his purpose:
  ]
  #p_quote[
    I would restore the reason that adorns magic itself, the ancient disciplines of all wise men, purge from it impious errors, and vindicate it from injury and misrepresentation.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    I leave it to you, gentle reader, to discern whether he has succeeded.

  #p_normal[
    Occult philosophy is the antidote to what a contemporary poet called “The War on the Imagination.” It is in our ability to enter the imaginal realm that the secrets of the ancients may be discovered. One strand of our DNA contains more information and computing power than the entire World Wide Web. At the end of every telescope, no matter how powerful, is an eye looking out trying to discern meaning.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    It is the relationship between the intelligence that creates this strand of genetic material and a knowledge and understanding of how, in an embodied state, this intelligence interacts with the natural world, the celestial world, and the angelic world that is the subject these pages.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Agrippa’s is an experimental and experiential philosophy:
  ]
  #p_quote[
    Hence from the virtues of the elemental world, magicians search through mixtures of various natural things through medicine and natural philosophy. Then, with influences from the rays of the celestial world, according to the rules of astronomers and mathematic disciplines, they connect with the virtues of the heavens. Next, they strengthen and confirm all manner of powerful intelligences through sacred religious ceremonies.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    That Agrippa’s seminal work, #emph[Three Books of Occult Philosophy,] has survived the cultural wars, land wars, and wars on the imaginative process for so many centuries is a tribute to its great worth. For Agrippa:
  ]
  #p_quote[
    This is the most perfect and highest science, the highest and most sacred philosophy. Finally, it is the absolute consummation of the noblest philosophy.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    It is this higher purpose that has given Agrippa’s voice longevity. It is our privilege to help restore this voice to its original clarity with this new translation—a voice that provides knowledge necessary to the magician’s craft and its operation in our world today.

    You hold in your hands the summit of the Western esoteric tradition: Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa’s famed #emph[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]. Seemingly dashed off in relative youth, this monumental work is a virtual one-stop shop of traditional Western esotericism; from the time of its writing in the high Renaissance to this day, it is unsurpassed in its breadth, depth, and encyclopedic treatment of the philosophy and practice of the hidden magical and astrological arts.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Famous and often notorious in the Renaissance, #emph[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]#t_footnote(1)[1] was never out of influence. The seventeenth-century J.F. English translation kept it at the forefront of what limited esoteric tradition continued in English after the onslaught of modern atheistic materialism. In the eighteenth century, Francis Barrett’s occult encyclopedia, #emph[The Magus,] quoted extensively from #emph[Three Books] without attribution. In the nineteenth century, #emph[Three Books] was a sourcebook for groups like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Modernly, there is considerable controversy over whether Mormon founder Joseph Smith possessed a Jupiter talisman—the design of which is right out of #emph[Three Books]. In its J.F. 1651 English translation, #emph[Three Books] was a bright spot of esoteric light in the darkness of a society that had largely turned away from esoteric knowledge and its own traditions.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But as useful as #emph[Three Books] has been, its easy availability and wide circulation ironically prejudiced many modern students of esoterism against it, following the assumption that esoteric knowledge must be hidden to be useful. But #emph[Three Books] is an arcanum, hidden in plain sight, obscured by its very accessibility and by the myriad problems with J.F.’s translation. Cloaked by the loss of traditional magical and astrological technique—as well as an unconscious modern worldview that rejects magic, spiritual beings, or spiritual causality—Agrippa’s text languished for centuries. Yet,
    #emph[Three Books of Occult Philosophy] contains the concentrated essence of the wisdom of myriad esoteric traditions. As Agrippa says in his letter of dedication to Book Three:
  ]
  #p_quote[
    I am also indebted to the divine and ceremonial mysteries of magic . . . of those ancient Isiac priests of the Egyptians, the ancient Chaldean prophets of the Babylonians, and divine wise Hebrew kabbalists. I am also [indebted to] the Orphics, Pythagoreans, and Platonists, profound Greek philosophers, Indian Brahmans, Ethiopian Gymnosophists, and our undefiled religious theologians.#t_footnote(2)[2]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The esoteric tradition represented by #emph[Three Books] went into an abrupt decline with the advent of the Enlightenment as Western society plunged into the depths of atheistic materialism. After a 370-year journey, we are finally approaching the heights scaled by our illustrious predecessors, finally ready to learn again what Agrippa has to teach. But we must take Agrippa on his own terms and do the work necessary for mastery. As Agrippa says in the final chapter of Book Three, the knowledge and wisdom contained here is
  ]
  #p_quote[
    written in order, some out of order, some delivered in fragments, some hidden and must be left for the intelligent to investigate, who can more acutely examine what is written and can likewise search for the complete documents of magical arts and can consequently infallibly experiment with them. Indeed, we have delivered these arts in such a way that they cannot happen to be hidden from the prudent and intelligent.#t_footnote(3)[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Thus, skimming once through #emph[Three Books of Occult Philosophy] at 100 mph will prove ineffectual for the reader, but repeated reading and deep contemplation will bear innumerable fruits. Even after twenty years of exposure to
    #emph[Three Books,] I find something useful, something amazing, and something profound every time I dip in to the text. Indeed, we must be in awe of the treasure that
    #emph[Three Books of Occult Philosophy] is; the title itself and organization into three books reveals Agrippa’s vision of the threefold manifestation of reality.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    There is a threefold world—that is, the elemental, celestial, and intellectual. Each inferior is ruled by its superior, accepting virtues flowing from the Archetype and highest Maker through angels, the heavens, stars, elements, animals, plants, metals, and stones.#t_footnote(4)[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Yet we must not be misled into thinking that these three worlds are some other physical location; in fact, they intermingle and interpenetrate, and all three worlds appear before us if we have the spiritual insight, offered by Agrippa, to see them.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Agrippa constantly balances seemingly wide and disparate topics with a focus on the unity of the three worlds. For example, the elements of earth, water, air, and fire are not simply material dirt or water, and so on. Rather, the four elements are states of matter corresponding to solid, liquid, vapor, and plasma or energized states, existing in varying levels in all material things. Agrippa shows the difference and unity of reality through the interpenetration of the three worlds, the elements making an excellent exemplar.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    Therefore, the elements are found everywhere and in everything, and no man can deny their manner. First, in the inferiors, they are feculent and dense, and in the heavens, they are pure and clear, and in the super-celestials, they are truly living and in all parts blessed.#t_footnote(5)[5]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But along with incredible philosophical insight, Agrippa presents an amazing amount of practical information, in particular, specific instructions for the creation of astrological talismans. He explains, for example, how to make multiple examples of the talismans of all seven planets.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    For the operations of Jupiter, they made images in the hour of Jupiter, with him happily rising in his exaltation, in a clear and white stone—these being for long life. The figure [of those images] is a crowned man, dressed in yellow garments, riding on an eagle or dragon and holding in his right hand an arrow, as if he were throwing it into the head of the same eagle or dragon.#t_footnote(6)[6]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But there is much more here than planetary talismans. #emph[Three Books] gives recipes for talismans of the 28 Mansions of the Moon, for the 15 key fixed stars, and the 36 decans, or faces, of the zodiac. He even delves into the most difficult and arcane type of astrological talisman, the house-based talisman, providing recipes for house-based talismans for such disparate purposes as love, wealth, and bringing good fortune to an entire city. Some of the most intriguing talismans are for prophetic and oracular dreams.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    There are also images made for dreams that are placed under the head of a sleeper who excels in causing dreams of truth for whatever thing the mind [of the sleeper] previously pondered: and the figure of it is the figure of a sleeping man in the bosom of an angel, which is made with Leo rising, the Sun in Aries posited in the ninth house. Then on the breast of the man, inscribe the name of the desired effect, but in the head of angel the name of the intelligence of the Sun.#t_footnote(7)[7]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Along with talisman recipes, Agrippa also includes (in Book Two, ch. 50) instructions for planetary tables, magic squares whose numbers added horizontally, vertically, and diagonally all equal the same sum. These tables can then be used to generate the sigils and symbols of planetary angels, spirits, and intelligences by inputting their names, making this one of the most useful and popular chapters in #emph[Three Books.] All in all, Book Two is a self-contained seminar in astrological magic, containing specific instructions for hundreds of astrological talismans.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Given the riches that it contains, I was very pleased when Eric Purdue asked me to write the foreword to this new translation, the first new translation in more than three hundred years. Very importantly, this translation utilized the 1992 Latin critical edition of #emph[Three Books of Occult Philosophy] by V. Perrone Compagni. That edition compared every extant manuscript and printed edition of #emph[Three Books,] explained variants, and was extensively footnoted and carefully researched.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    While the J.F. 1651 translation is serviceable, there are multiple problems. First, seventeenth-century English is increasingly obscure and difficult for contemporary readers, particularly if they are not native English speakers. Next, there are problematic translated passages that pose obstacles to a clear understanding of the text at a number of points. By using modern English and utilizing the Latin critical edition, Eric Purdue has produced a superlative translation. Not only are previously obscure passages now intelligible, but Eric has also included hundreds of footnotes citing the specific sources quoted by Agrippa. Eric also has been careful with the technical details of traditional astrological technique, making his translation an excellent resource for both the scholarly researcher and the practicing astrological magician.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    It is useful to point out a few specific instances that make it clear how much improved Eric’s translation is over the J.F. translation and its commentators, though we should point out that Donald Tyson’s 1993 commentary on the J.F. translation is yeoman’s work. The problems that arise are simply due to Tyson lacking the mastery of traditional astrology possessed by Eric Purdue. If we look at Book Two, ch. 30, Agrippa discusses when planets are powerful or, in traditional astrological terminology, when they are dignified. The Latin original speaks of planets being #emph[succedentibus] and #emph[suis gaudiis,] which J.F. translated as “presently succeeding” and “delights,” respectively. Tyson, in footnotes 8 and 9, explains “presently succeeding” using a quote from Ptolemy about planets approaching the Midheaven, saying, “[t]he succedent is in this case the house immediately following—the one on the left of the house in question.” “Delights” is explained, by again citing Ptolemy, as having to do with sect, a totally separate astrological term, and that “Venus would be said to rejoice in Aries, because Aries is ruled by Mars and Mars is in the sect of the Moon.”#t_footnote(8)[8] Unfortunately, the J.F. translation is incorrect, and Tyson’s explanations move further from Agrippa’s intention. Eric correctly translates #emph[succedentibus] as “succedent,” which is a very standard traditional classification of houses (the 2nd, 5th, 8th, and 11th houses) that are of middling strength. Similarly, Eric translates #emph[suis gaudiis] as “its joy,” another very straightforward traditional dignity. And this is just one chapter out of 199!
  ]
  #p_normal[
    It is this meticulous attention to detail, knowledge of traditional astrological technique, and careful use of the earliest complete Latin manuscript in conjunction with Compagni’s critical edition that distinguishes Eric’s translation of #emph[Three Books of Occult Philosophy.] As useful as the 1651 J.F. translation has been, it has now been surpassed by this new, definitive, modern translation. Any serious student of Western esotericism, whether of a scholarly bent or set on actually putting Agrippa’s strictures into practice, is well served by this translation. Years in the making, eagerly awaited, we now can enjoy the fruits of Eric’s long labors and delve deep into this key source of Western traditional, natural, astrological, and divine philosophy and magic.

    Translator’s Introduction
  ]
  #p_normal(italic: true)[
    Eric Purdue
  ]
  #p_normal[
    THE PRESENT TRANSLATION of #emph[Three Books of Occult Philosophy] (hereafter called #emph[Three Books]) marks the first translation from Latin to English since the J.F. translation in 1651. #emph[Three Books]’s influence in the metaphysical textual tradition is incalculable. Its influence is especially found in modern books on herbalism, stones, incense, and in nineteenth-century British lodge magical systems. While all the information contained in #emph[Three Books] can be found in other books, Agrippa’s text is unique in its scope and organization. While some individual texts that Agrippa quoted may contain more detailed information, #emph[Three Books] systematically organizes the vast array into a cohesive whole. This introduction will summarize #emph[Three Books,] explain its textual history, and discuss why a new translation is necessary. Notes on the new translation detail some important considerations that distinguish the present edition from the epochal 1651 version of J.F.
  ]
  #l_section[
    #p_normal[
      All prior English editions of #emph[Three Books] are based on the 1651 J.F. translation. This translation has served as a basis, as mentioned above, for many sources and spiritual practices—particularly over the past two centuries. After beginning a fresh translation from the original Latin, some interesting highlights began to appear.
    ]
    #l_ordered(
      l_ordered_item[
        #strong[Mistranslations]. While all translations contain errors, many fundamental errors or unusual translation choices in the J.F. version have resulted in a sometimes confusing text. For example, the Latin #emph[daemon,] literally “demon” in English but with a historically and theologically more complex meaning, is often translated as “spirit” by J.F. This creates a misunderstanding in Agrippa’s chapter on planetary seals in Book Two, ch. 22, where spirit is defined as evil. Another example is Book Three, ch. 43, in which J.F. translated the term #emph[idolum] as “sense” or “sensitive.” #emph[Idolum] is a technical term referring to the lowest level of the soul. Translating it as “sense” is misleading.
      ],
      l_ordered_item[
        #strong[Lack of technical knowledge]. Several examples of mistranslations of basic astrological terms and techniques suggest that J.F.’s astrological knowledge was lacking. In Book 1, ch. 59, J.F. translated the Latin #emph[profectionis] as “perfection.” The correct translation should be “profection.” Profections are a well-known premodern astrological predictive technique. At the time of J.F.’s translation, profections were still widely used, so it is surprising he translated it incorrectly. Another example is in Book Two, ch. 22, where J.F. translated #emph[termini] as “marks.” This is known in premodern astrology as “terms” or “bounds,” a five-fold division of each of the zodiacal signs. In the same chapter, he confused a section on planetary rulerships, giving the wrong planets to the wrong set of rulerships. This was likely due to the way the Latin sentence was constructed, but had he some basic astrological knowledge this would have been clear. Our translation is the first one written by a practitioner of premodern astrology.
      ],
      l_ordered_item[
        #strong[Animal and botanical names.] Just as today, local names for animals, plants, and stones can be unique to regions or countries even if they speak the same language. As such, translations from older texts can be problematic. Modern Latin dictionaries are sometimes more helpful today than in J.F.’s seventeenth century, but they are not foolproof. However, J.F. made several questionable translation choices. All of these discrepancies are noted. In some cases, Agrippa most likely did not know a few of the herbs and stones about which he was writing as many were sourced from Pliny. Even today, some of Pliny’s references remain mysterious. Every effort was made to show the original Latin, probable English translation, and incorrect translations.
      ],
      l_ordered_item[
        #strong[The archaic English is sometimes distracting or misleading.] J.F.’s English is more than 350 years old. While his English is quite readable, some styles and terminology can be distracting to modern eyes. In some cases, the meanings have changed or words have fallen out of common use. In this translation, we refer to the original Latin directly rather than modernizing an earlier translation.
      ],
      l_ordered_item[
        #strong[Some graphics are incorrect.] Agrippa’s works were published in many editions, and some graphical differences appeared in various printings. J.F. reproduces some incorrect graphics or introduces new ones. For example, some of the planetary seals in J. F.’s Book Two, ch. 22, differ from the Latin original in that they are oriented incorrectly. All of these errors have been corrected and noted.
      ],
      l_ordered_item[
        #strong[All of these have compounded errors in later editions]. All post-1651 English editions up to this point are based on the J.F. translation. We will discuss the textual history later in this introduction. However, it should be noted here that the various editors worked with the flaws in J.F.’s translation. Sometimes these flaws were noticed but were attributed to Agrippa. Other times the flaws were not noticed and were expounded upon. This is most notably apparent in Donald Tyson’s 1993 edition. In his version, Tyson attempts to explain all of Agrippa’s sources and concepts in as much detail as possible. Because he is using J.F.’s translation, these explanations often make these errors worse. That they have been expounded upon by an expert also has the effect of making them seem more authoritative. For example, Tyson incorrectly explains J.F.’s mistranslation of
        #emph[profection] as referring to a new or full Moon. Actually, the term refers to a practice of counting the houses around the chart in which each is understood to represent a year. Tyson also accuses Agrippa of “not reading his Plato correctly,” when in fact it is J.F. who mistranslates the element of Earth as changeable instead of unchangeable in Book One, ch. 3. Some of these discrepancies in Tyson are noted in our own translation, but the present text aims to emphasize the core English translations rather than later editions.
      ],
    )
    #p_normal[
      Most importantly, the primary purpose of creating a new, authoritative edition of Agrippa’s #emph[Three Books] is to take a fresh look at the original Latin. The secondary purpose was to obtain and cross-reference as many of Agrippa’s sources as possible. Tyson attempted this in his 1993 edition, but he often favored sources that Agrippa either could not have read because they were not available in his time, sources that Agrippa simply would not have used, or sources that did not exist during Agrippa’s lifetime. Our translation attempts as much as possible to cite sources that were available to Agrippa. This has allowed us to largely reconstruct Agrippa’s library and has demystified his method of obtaining it. This shows that Agrippa, rather than the writing from texts now missing or obtaining books from secret sources, instead was a mainstream scholar of his day, using texts widely available. These are noted in our translation. In a few cases, identification of Agrippa’s sources has shown some transcription errors on his part. These are noted as well.

      The text is divided into three large sections, these being the titular #emph[Three Books]. Book One is about the natural world.

      Despite the clear structure of #emph[Three Books,] Agrippa does not completely isolate the individual subjects within their respective chapters. He builds upon his earlier comments and revisits previous points of discussion throughout the text. Because of this, approaching #emph[Three Books] as a reference only without reading it through will leave the reader with an incomplete understanding. Agrippa states this in his conclusion, explaining that he has “scattered” the material. This is not entirely correct as the book still follows its structure. He does, however, define or introduce items in one section of the book and then reintroduce them later as part of a related or larger subject, assuming the reader has read the entire book and understands the subject matter. Picking and choosing individual chapters based on their titles can result in an incomplete picture of Agrippa’s ideas.

      In 1510, when Agrippa was twenty-four years old, he presented the first draft of #emph[Three Books] to a friend, the Abbot Johannes Trithemius. Agrippa spent a short time the previous year with Trithemius, who encouraged him with his studies and approved of his work in progress. After Agrippa sent his draft to Trithemius, the abbot sent a reply further encouraging Agrippa and cautioned him to be circumspect with the material he divulges.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      It is one of the surprising accidents of history that this juvenile draft of #emph[Three Books] survives today, as this appears to be the presentation copy given by Agrippa to Trithemius.#t_footnote(9)[1] The first draft of#emph[ Three Books ] remained as a manuscript and was never published, but it somewhat resembles the final edition published twenty-three years later. However, it is much smaller, about a third of the size of the final version, but there is little material that does not appear in the final version. This first draft draws on texts well known to most Renaissance scholars: the complete works of Ficino, Pliny the Elder, Pico Della Mirandola, and many others. It also makes use of works by authors contemporary to Agrippa, such as Johann Reuchlin, of whom Agrippa was an avid student. Reuchlin’s #emph[De Verbo Mirifico] factors heavily in this earliest version, and his #emph[De Arte Cabbalistica]—which would not be published for another seven years—would be important for the final draft. The seeds that were planted with this draft informed Agrippa’s writing in his later years.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      In the years that followed his first draft of #emph[Three Books,] Agrippa continued to write other works and letters. Some remained unpublished until years later. One of his notable works was #emph[De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum atque artium, atque excellentia verbi Dei declamatio] (A Declamation of the Uncertainty and Vanity of the Sciences and Arts, and the Most Excellent Word of God) in 1526–1527. #emph[De incertitudine] was a satirical criticism on all areas of human knowledge. This work is the cause of a great deal of debate about whether Agrippa retracted this most famous work.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      In chapter 48 of #emph[De incertitudine,] Agrippa appears to admit that his studies of the occult in his youth were a mistake and discourage others from pursuing such matters. He refers to this in his “To the Reader” in #emph[Three Books,] saying that “when I was a child, I had the understanding of a child; but now that I’m a man I purged the things I did as a child, and in our book #emph[The Vanity and Uncertainty of the Sciences,] I retracted part of this great book.” The question to many is whether Agrippa was sincere in his retraction. This question may never be answered, but one thing is clear: while Agrippa was writing this retraction, he was expanding and editing #emph[Three Books,] which would be published six years later. Agrippa admitted in the same section that unapproved and flawed editions of #emph[Three Books] had leaked out, and he felt that if he was going to be criticized, then it would be better if at least it was by his own hand.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      In 1531, the first book of #emph[Three Books] was published, and finally, in 1533, the final and complete edition was printed in Cologne. This expanded edition reflected several new sources that became available to Agrippa after 1510. The two most notable are Reuchlin’s #emph[De Arte Cabbalistica] (1517) and Francesco Giorgio’s #emph[De harmonia mundi totius] (1525), both influencing Agrippa’s kabbalistic material. Giorgio is especially represented in #emph[Three Books]. In some cases, full chapters of #emph[Three Books] are composed of material from #emph[De harmonia mundi].
    ]
    #p_normal[
      The 1533 edition follows the same structure as the 1510 manuscript, but Agrippa’s increased knowledge and life experience, plus his more mature literary hand, makes this version smoother to read and is a worthy version to act as a cap on his literary career. It is the last book he published, as Agrippa passed away two years later.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      After Agrippa’s death, his #emph[Opera Omnia] was published in two volumes, which included his spuriously attributed book, #emph[The Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy]. These volumes introduced errors, particularly in the illustrations, which have been copied many times, including into English versions.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      In 1651, an English translation appeared by the mysterious J.F. These initials are often identified as James Freake, but Donald Tyson, in his edition, questions whether the identity of this translator was a little-known alchemist named James French. Regardless, as mentioned above, the depth of J.F.’s knowledge of some important concepts is questionable. This English translation, for all of its flaws and idiosyncrasies, became a core source for nineteenth-and twentieth-century metaphysics.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      In 1897, Willis Whitehead published Book One of #emph[Three Books]. This edition if the first attempt to edit the J.F. translation for modern audiences, modernizing the spelling and adding footnotes and appendices. While easier to read, that edition incorporates in his commentaries Theosophical and metaphysical ideas popular with ninteenth-century practitioners. Whitehead never published the final two books. This version of Agrippa is still published by various small publishers.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      In 1993, Donald Tyson published his ambitious edition and commentary of the J.F. translation. Tyson meticulously annotated every chapter of #emph[Three Books,] as well as attempted to locate as many of Agrippa’s sources as possible and make corrections as Tyson saw them. As mentioned above, flaws in the J.F. translation made future annotations and corrections potentially problematic.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      We spoke above about some of the problems with the J.F. translation. Tyson seemed to be unaware of which errors were from J.F. and which were from Agrippa. Agrippa bore the brunt of the blame. Some of the corrections Tyson made were warranted and some were unneeded, thus compounding the problems. However, more issues arose with Tyson’s attempts at locating sources.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      Agrippa’s sources can seem mysterious to modern audiences. There are two reasons: Agrippa rarely cited his sources, and modern audiences are not as familiar with the texts available to the Renaissance scholar. This has led to the belief, echoed by Tyson in his introduction, that Agrippa had access to texts that are now lost. Agrippa instead used sources that were common to scholars of his time, and nearly all of these are found easily today.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      Tyson’s attempt at noting Agrippa’s sources, while useful for background information, is generally not correct. For example, when #emph[Three Books] mentions a reference to Plato, Agrippa is more likely quoting from a passage from Ficino or Giorgio that refers to Plato. Agrippa rarely quoted directly from Plato because he would have had access to Plato only through translations by Ficino, his commentaries, or others influenced by him. This is surprisingly also true of many of his quotes from the Bible. Although Agrippa, of course, would have had access to or owned a Bible, his pattern of quotes clearly follows citations from other sources.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      Agrippa uses about two hundred sources to write #emph[Three Books,] but the bulk of the book is made of a smaller fraction of that total. Tyson notes as many primary sources as he can find, but in 1993 a number of academic studies that might have assisted him in this task had yet to be published. He also adds references to secondary or more modern sources with the aim of shedding additional light on Agrippa’s ideas. Though these are sometimes useful, they do not help the reader understand Agrippa’s methodology.
    ]
  ]
  #l_section[
    #p_normal[
      The present volume is a new translation of Agrippa’s original Latin text. The primary source is V. Perrone Compagni’s 1992 critical edition of #emph[Three Books,] published by Brill. Compagni gathers every extant edition of the text and notes their variations so as to create a “perfect” version. Since #emph[Three Books] has always existed in printed form, it might seem surprising that there would be variations. However, in the sixteenth century, printed books were typeset by hand, and thus the different editions contained slight variations. These are noted. Compagni also had access to the first manuscript of #emph[Three Books,] which Agrippa gave to Trithemius, and notes variations from this manuscript. Finally, in perhaps her most valuable contribution, she adds notation regarding most of Agrippa’s sources and, in some cases, secondary sources.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      In our translation, we began with consulting the Latin edition(s) first. While Compagni was the primary source, we also consulted other editions of #emph[Three Books] when necessary. These were the Cologne 1533, Lyon 1551, and two more with unidentified printers. As many as possible of Compagni’s noted sources were consulted and verified. We were unable to locate a few of these sources. These unlocated sources were noted as “Compagni cited . . .” We were able to find some sources Compagni did not identify. Every source is noted within the text, and full citations are in the bibliography.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      While verifying sources, another surprise was that Agrippa made few errors. Some errors were found, however, typically due to typographical errors. We translated every word of #emph[Three Books] according to Agrippa’s words. If we discovered an error by Agrippa, the main text keeps the error unless that error is obviously meant to be something else, and we noted the correction in a footnote, and in most cases, the original Latin word or passage is noted.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      It was surprising to us that the majority of #emph[Three Books] is compiled by direct quotations from Agrippa’s sources. We discovered that few sections are in his own words. His citations are so diverse and dense that some sentences are compiled from more than one source. To show this, sources are noted with the first few words and last few of the quoted passage with a footnote.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      Because the J.F. translation is an important source for Western metaphysics, we felt that it was important to note important errors or differences found in their translation. These are noted in footnotes with the original Latin for transparency’s sake. The same was done with references for the Tyson edition, as we felt that it was important to understand what changes were made by J.F. and which by Tyson.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      Animal and botanical names were sometimes problematic. J.F. was frequently incorrect, and in some cases bafflingly so. Tyson was sometimes helpful, but not always. The most difficult sections were often sourced from Pliny the Elder’s #emph[Natural History].
      Today, even academic Latinists are unable to identify some of Pliny’s plant names. It is doubtful that Agrippa knew what some of these were. We have identified as many of these plants and animals as possible, but some, regrettably, must remain untranslated. When there is a discrepancy from J.F. or Tyson, these are noted with the original Latin.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      Agrippa used verse to strengthen his arguments or to illustrate them. J.F.’s translations of these poems are often troublesome—partially because of the seventeenth-century English and partially because the translations are sometimes incorrect. We have made no attempt to maintain the meter or rhyme in our translation. Instead, we opted to simply translate the passages to be as clear as possible.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      Words with square brackets represent words added to the text to make the translation easier to read. Additionally, we adapted the Latin sentence structure in some cases and added paragraph breaks for easier reading.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      All of the illustrations in this volume are from the original Latin. Most are from the 1533 Cologne edition and have been retouched. Nothing else has been altered or added. Tables are re-created as they are in the original.
    ]
    #p_normal[
      Our goal is that this translation will stand as an accurate baseline for further study. To understand #emph[Three Books,] we must read it on its own terms. We must not modernize it or simplify it for modern audiences, but this does not mean that the text should be difficult to read. We hope that we have achieved our goal, and we can hear Agrippa speak again.

    To the Reader
  ]
  #p_normal[
    I do not doubt that the title of our book, #emph[Three Books of Occult Philosophy or Magic], will attract many readers because of its uniqueness. Among those attracted [to this book], some have the twisted beliefs of a weak mind, and others will come to us with a spiteful and ungrateful nature. With their reckless ignorance, they believe that magic is of the lowest order, and though hardly noticing the title, will claim that I teach forbidden arts, that I scatter the seeds of heresy, offend pious ears, tempt noble characters, that I am wicked, superstitious, demonic, and a magician.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    To these people I respond that to a learned man, a magician is not wicked or superstitious and should not be called demonic but instead wise, a priest, and a prophet. The Sibyls were Magi who openly prophesied about Christ, and indeed from the secret wonders of the world, the Magi recognized Christ, who was about to be born, as the authority of all and were the first to arrive and honor Him. Additionally, the name “magic” was accepted by philosophers and lauded by theologians, and the Gospels did not disapprove of it.#t_footnote(10)[1] I believe these same persistently arrogant censors would rather condemn the Sibyls, the sacred Magi, and even the Gospels themselves, rather than to gracefully accept the name “magic.” Such is their conscience, that I could not be vindicated from their curses if I consulted Apollo, the Muses, or all the angels of Heaven. To these [ignorant] people, I advise that they do not read our writings, that they do not understand them, or remember them because they are poisonous.#t_footnote(11)[2] The Gate of Acheron#t_footnote(12)[3] is in this book: it speaks stones. Be careful or your brains will be smashed out.#t_footnote(13)[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, those of you who come to read [our book] with a level mind, and with great prudence and discretion like bees gathering honey, come and read safely. I believe that you will receive a great amount of use and pleasure. But if you find things that displease you, ignore and do not use them, for I also disapprove, but nonetheless, I recorded it. Do not reject the rest:#t_footnote(14)[5] for if one examines the books of physicians, they will read about antidotes and drugs, as well as poisons. I admit that magic contains many superfluities and teaches curiously ostentatious prodigies. Likewise, leave these as empty, but do not ignore their causes. If they avert evil events, destroy black magic, cure disease, banish spirits, preserve life, and give honor and fortune without offense to God or injury to religion, are not these things useful and necessary to men?
  ]
  #p_normal[
    I have been heavily admonishing you with my narration rather than affirming what is written. Indeed, this would seem to be thus so that we would discard few things—following many of the principles stated above of Platonists and other pagan philosophers, where their writings suggested proof of our traditions. Therefore, if there is an error somewhere
    or something spoken too freely, pardon our youth. Indeed I was younger when I composed this work, and I would excuse myself by saying: “That when I was a child, I had the understanding of a child; but now that I am a man I purged the things I did as a child, and in our book #emph[The Vanity and Uncertainty of the Sciences,] I retracted part of this great book.” But here again, you might refute me by saying: “Look at what you’ve written as a young man and retracted as an old man. What then have you produced?”#t_footnote(15)[6]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    I admit that as a young man I eagerly wrote these books, yet I hoped that some day I might be able to make corrections and additions. For this reason, I sent them to Johannes Trithemius, the Neapolitan abbot formerly of Sponheim,#t_footnote(16)[7] a man who is very studious for secret things, and the first to whom I sent corrections. It just so happened that the work was intercepted before he was able to impose his great hand, and the corrupted [version] of the work was carried to Italy, France, and Germany and flew through many hands. Now some of those people (I do not know if they were impatient or imprudent) wished to send this deformed work to press. With this single overpowering evil placed before me, I thought that the door to danger would be less if books were produced from my somewhat restrained hand rather than they be made known in mangled and rough fragments through other hands. In any case, I felt it was not a sin if I did not allow my youthful ideas to die.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, we added several small chapters, which would have been seen as careless if we omitted them, but a careful reader will easily be able to see them because of their inconsistent phrasing. Indeed, we have been unwilling to alter the work itself, and as they say, we’ve uncovered the entire web,#t_footnote(17)[8] but there is little here worth scolding for, and to some degree actually holds some brilliance. Therefore, again I beg you, kind reader, that you balance this present edition and indulge the curiosities of my youth, and if it offends you, that you might understand.
