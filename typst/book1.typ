    R.P.D.#t_footnote(18)[1] Johannes Trithemius, abbot of Saint James in the suburbs of Wurzburg,#t_footnote(19)[2] Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim sends greetings.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    #emph[Recently, venerable father, we spoke for some time at your monastery in Wurzburg about chemistry, magic, kabbalah, and other things that thus far are hidden in secrecy, and about hidden sciences and arts, but all are united together. The greatest of these questions was why the sacred Fathers from the very beginning of the Catholic Church, became offended and suspicious of magic itself, since it was once the primary summit and held by all the ancient philosophers, wise men, and priests in veneration. In the end, theologians rejected it, the sacred canons condemned it, and it was forbidden in all existing laws and principles.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    #emph[The reason for this, I judged, was nothing else than a certain fated abnormality of the time, and men adopted many pseudo-philosophies through various erroneous sects and false religious factions, many of which were wholly cursed superstitions and wild rites. Also, there were many wicked sacrileges through orthodox religion that persecuted nature, ruined men, and injured God. Finally, many, as we see today, produce forbidden books, onto which the name “magic” is prominently placed by theft and robbery.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    #emph[Therefore they, with their accursed frivolities, hope to be labeled with the sacred name of magic. They have driven that which was called magic, which was formerly praised, to what is today seen as odious to all that is good and honest. Also those who call themselves magicians in doctrines and works are indicted with capital crimes],#t_footnote(20)[3] #emph[unless perhaps one wishes to believe that a demented elderly country dweller is highly skilled and has a “divine power.” As Apuleius said, they can “let the sky fall, suspend the earth, harden the springs, wash away the mountains, raise the dead, weaken the gods, extinguish the stars, and illuminate Tartarus,”]#t_footnote(21)[4] #emph[or as Virgil sang:]

  #p_normal[
    #emph[Moreover, Lucan referred to the magic of Thessala]#t_footnote(23)[6] #emph[and Homer to the omnipotence of Circe,]#t_footnote(24)[7] #emph[many of which, I confess, are nevertheless false opinions and prove to be persistent superstitions and destructive works, since as they don’t fall under impious arts, they presume to clothe themselves under the venerable title of magic.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    #emph[Therefore, with things as they are, I was amazed—and no less scornful—that so far no one has stepped forward to vindicate this sublime and sacred discipline from impious crimes or deliver it purely and honestly. Some writers that I have recently seen promise to speak about magic: Roger Bacon, Robertus Anglicus, Pietro d’Abano, Albertus Magnus,]#t_footnote(25)[8] #emph[Arnaldus de Villa Nova, Giorgio Anselmi,]#t_footnote(26)[9] #emph[Picatrix the Spaniard,]#t_footnote(27)[10] #emph[Cecco d’Ascoli,]#t_footnote(28)[11] #emph[and many other writers]#t_footnote(29)[12] #emph[with obscure names. However, when they do so it is not without certain delusions, unreliable reasoning, or superstitions that are unworthy of anyone who is honest.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    #emph[Hence, my spirit was moved. I wished with combined admiration and indignation, and I desired and philosophized, that I would create a worthy work, since from the beginning of my life, I have always been a curious and undaunted explorer for wonderful effects and works full of mysteries. I would restore the reason that adorns magic itself, the ancient disciplines of all wise men, purge from it impious errors, and vindicate it from injury and misrepresentation.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    #emph[I had thought about this for a long time but had not yet dared to penetrate this challenge. However, after our meeting in Wurzburg where we talked about these things, your preeminent skills and ardent learning persuaded and encouraged me. So, by selecting the opinions of philosophers with a confirmed faith and purging the introduction of the malignant (who repeat the false knowledge that magical traditions must be learned from forbidden books and from sanctuaries with wonderful works), I shattered the darkness.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    #emph[In these short recent days, I composed these three compendious books called] Three Books of Occult Philosophy, #emph[which is a less offensive title, that you now examine. These things of which you hold a complete skill, I submit to you to correct and assess. If I have written something that offends nature or the heavens, or injures religion, condemn the error. However, if you dissolve and purge the scandal of impiety, you might protect the true tradition. Thus, one might conduct magic with these books, so that whatever is useful is not hidden, and disapprove that which does harm.]

    #emph[With these books approved with your examination, may they finally be in happy auspices and go forth publicly with no fear and be judged by posterity. Farewell, and pardon my audacious undertaking.]

    #emph[We examined your work, distinguished Agrippa, titled] The Occult Philosophy, #emph[which you delivered by this messenger. We have accepted it with greater pleasure than any mortal tongue can pronounce, or any pen can reveal. With great wonder we thought of your above common education, which you as a young man penetrated such secrets and mysteries, many of which were hidden from learned men, you brought them to light not only beautifully and truthfully but also properly and richly. For this, I am especially grateful to your benevolence, and if I am able at some time, I will repay that gratitude. I approve your work, which no learned man can praise enough.]

Nor shall you withdraw your intentions from the gaze of worthless people, of whom the true saying is “The tired ox stamps his foot strongly”]#t_footnote(30)[1] #emph[since no wise man can truly be judged as learned who is sworn only to the rudiments of one skill.]

Indeed, it is thought that the more learned one is, they are ignorant of that much less. However, your talents are entirely appropriate for everything—not the few or the bottom—but for rationally grasping the many and the sublime. Yet allow me to remind you to take heed of one teaching: share the vulgar with the vulgar, and the higher and more secret to higher and more secret friends only: give hay to oxen and sugar to parrots. Understand my reasoning, lest you (as it happens to most) be thrown under the hooves of the oxen.]

  #p_normal[
    #emph[Such is the illustrious reputation of your fame—venerable and illustrious prince—that your great virtue, splendid learning, frequent exercise of good letters, unbroken prudence of your important orations, eagerness of eloquent speech, knowledge of many things, steadfast religion, and laudable morals have endowed you above the common customs of others. I have not mentioned the ancient images of your eminent nobility, wealth, treasures old and new, the greatness of your dominion, and the sacred dignity of your miter. In these you surpass the strength and form of your body with excellence.]

  #p_normal[
    #emph[Though all of these are great, I value you far more than all of these heroic and illustrious virtues, which certainly you caused, by which each man who has great learning and loves virtue will desire to be introduced into your benevolence that much more. I also desire to be placed in your glory, but in the customs of the Parthians—as they say, not without tribute—which indeed is the custom for saluting princes from the ancient world all the way to our time. Here we see it fully observed. I often see other distinguished, learned men furnishing you with beautiful and great gifts. So that I am not the only deserter of your cultivation and veneration daring to apply myself to you with empty hands, I thought and looked around the books in my room for what gift I can give to a famous prince as yourself. I suddenly saw hidden between the offerings the book] The Occult Philosophy #emph[or Magic, which I undertook at a very young age and now after many years had forgotten. I hurried as if it were a vow to finish the book and deliver it soon to your venerable Greatness. Certainly, I persuaded myself that I could give to you nothing more pleasing than a new work of ancient and hidden learning—a work, I say, of our curious youth, but ancient learning, I dare say, that no one thus far has restored. But we did not write these books to you because they are worthy of you, but instead so that I might reveal myself to your benevolence. Therefore I beseech you, if it is not improper, that you may excuse certain things, with all your preceding vows, that the studies of my youth come to the greatness of your auspicious notice, chasing away envy, and those that preserve the truth shall remain with us for the fruit of good conscience, since I have seen many of these, even as I am older, and many are useful, and moreover necessary to understand.]

    Chapter 1. How magicians collect virtues of the threefold world will be shown in these three books.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    There is a threefold world—that is, the elemental, celestial, and intellectual. Each inferior is ruled by its superior,#t_footnote(36)[1] accepting virtues flowing from the Archetype and highest Maker through angels, the heavens, stars, elements, animals, plants, metals, and stones. The Maker transfers His omnipotent virtue into us, for whose service He placed and created all of these. Wise men do not find it irrational that we can rise by these same degrees, through each world, toward the same archetypal world, the Maker of all and the First Cause, from which everything exists and all proceeds. Not only can more noble things profit from these virtues, but they can also attract new virtues from above.#t_footnote(37)[2]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Hence from the virtues of the elemental world, magicians search through mixtures of various natural things through medicine and natural philosophy. Then, with influences from the rays of the celestial world according to the rules of astronomers and mathematic disciplines, they connect with the virtues of the heavens. Next, they strengthen and confirm all manner of powerful intelligences through sacred religious ceremonies. I will now attempt to relate the order and processes of these things in the present three books: the first of which contains natural magic, the second of the heavens, and the third of ceremonies.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    I do not know whether it was presumptuous that I—a man of small talent and letters—should have thought myself worthy to freely approach such a difficult, arduous, and intricate work in my youth. Whatever is said by me here and below, no one should assent to any of it (nor will I) except for those things that the Catholic Church and assembly of the faithful have not condemned.

  #p_normal[
    Magical ability possesses great power,#t_footnote(38)[1] full of the highest mysteries, contemplating profound secret things, natures, powers, qualities, substances, and virtues, combined with the understanding of all of nature. It instructs us on how things are different from each other and how they agree. Wonderful effects are produced from magic, uniting virtues by applying things with each other and by accepting their congruity,#t_footnote(39)[2] and everywhere binds and marries inferior and superior gifts and virtues. This is the most perfect and highest science, the highest and most sacred philosophy. Finally, it is the absolute consummation of the noblest philosophy, for all regulative philosophy is divided into natural science, mathematics, and theology.

In addition, it instructs us about faith, miracles, the virtues of words and figures, about secret operations and mysteries of seals, and as Apuleius said, teaches us to “duly know and understand ceremonial law, sacred divine will, and even binding religious law.”#t_footnote(54)[17]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But now I have to collect myself. These three powerful faculties of magic embrace, unite, and actuate.#t_footnote(55)[18] Therefore, the ancients valued magic as the highest and most sacred science.#t_footnote(56)[19] It is found illuminated clearly in the writings of these important writers, especially Zalmoxis and Zoroaster, who shined forth to such an extent that many believed that they were the inventors of this science.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    These writers followed in their footsteps: Abaris the Hyperborean, Charmondas, Damigeron, Eudoxus, Hermippus. Other authors clearly stand out, such as Hermes Trismegistus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Plotinus, Proclus, Dardanus, Orpheus the Thracian, Gog the Greek, Germa the Babylonian, and Apollonius of Tyana.#t_footnote(57)[20] Osthanes, whose books Democritus of Abdera plucked out of the grave and embellished with commentaries, is also an exceptional writer in this art.#t_footnote(58)[21]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    In addition, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato traveled to learn this noble philosophy, and they returned proclaiming that its teachings held the highest sanctity and secrets.#t_footnote(59)[22] In fact, Pythagoras and Plato approached Memphite prophets to acquire knowledge and traveled through almost all of Syria, Egypt, Judea, and the Chaldean schools so that they would be instructed in the sacred magical records and divine things.#t_footnote(60)[23]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, whoever means to study these faculties, if they are not educated in natural philosophy—in which the qualities of things are declared and in which one can reveal hidden qualities of anything that exists—and if they are not a worker in mathematics and in the aspects and figures of the stars, from which anything with a sublime virtue and quality depends, and if they are not skilled in theology, where immaterial substances are shown, which all are dispensed and administered, they cannot understand the rationale of magic.#t_footnote(61)[24] Indeed, there is no perfect work in magic or any work that is truly magical that does not embrace these three faculties.

    Chapter 3. Of the four elements, their qualities, and their mixtures with each other.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    There are four elements, and they are the primary foundation of all corporeal things: fire, earth, water, and air. All inferior bodies are composed from these elements, not by heaping them together, but by transmutation and union. Then, when corrupted, they are dissolved into elements.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, none of the sensible elements are pure, but are more or less mixed, and are transmuted into each other, just as earth is dissolved into mud in water and then hardens and thickens with earth. But with heat, it evaporates and crosses over into air, then when inflamed into fire, and when extinguished reverts back into air. When cooled from burning it becomes earth, stone, or sulfur, which is manifested from lightning.#t_footnote(62)[1]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Plato thought that earth is entirely unchangeable,#t_footnote(63)[2] but the other elements changed both into themselves and into each other. Therefore, earth is divided from the more subtle and not changed but is loosened or mixed with the others where it does not [entirely] dissolve, and then returns back into itself again.#t_footnote(64)[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Each of the elements has two specific qualities. The first quality is held as its own, and the other is, as it were, a middle in common with the next: indeed fire is hot and dry, earth is dry and cold, water is cold and moist, air is moist and hot.#t_footnote(65)[4] According to this manner, two elements of opposite qualities are opposite to each other, as fire is to water and earth to air. Thus, in this way, the elements have their opposites.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    For instance, there are the heavy, as with earth and water, and the light, as with air and fire. Of which the heavy are passive, and the light are active, as said by the Stoics. Yet according to Plato, he distinguishes these in another way, where he assigns these three qualities: fire is sharpness, thinness, and movement, but earth is dullness, thickness, and rest. According to these qualities, the elements of fire and earth are opposite. But the remaining elements borrow from those qualities. Thus [for air] two qualities are taken from fire (thinness and movement) and one from earth (dullness), and then to the opposite, water takes two from earth (dullness and thickness), and one from fire (movement).#t_footnote(66)[5]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But fire is twice as thin as air, three times as moveable, and four times as sharp. Air is twice as sharp as water, three times as thin, and four times as moveable. Water is twice as sharp as earth, three times as thin, and four times as moveable. Therefore, as fire is to air, thus air is to water and water to earth and then as earth is to water, and thus air is to fire.#t_footnote(67)[6]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    This is the root and foundation of all bodies, natures, virtues, and wonderful operations. One who has a complete and ready understanding of the qualities of these elements and mixtures will bring about astounding miraculous operations and will be perfect in natural magic.#t_footnote(68)[7]
  ]
]

#character[
  #p_title[
    Chapter 4. Of the rationale of the threefold consideration of the elements.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    There are four elements as we have said, without perfect notice of which we can effectively produce nothing perfect in magic. Each of the elements is threefold. As such, four of each becomes twelve, through seven into the number ten, and they proceed to supreme unity.#t_footnote(69)[1] All virtues and wonderful operations depend on the elements, and progressions happen from them.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, the first order of elements are pure and are not compounded, not modified, and not allowed to mix, yet they are incorruptible and the virtues of all natural things produce effects not by them but through them. No one can explain their virtues, because through them all is possible in all things. Indeed, one who ignores them cannot complete any wonderful operations.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The second order of elements is compounded, many-layered, varied, and impure yet reducible by art to a pure simplicity. When they are returned to their simplicity, their virtue above all completes all occult and natural operations: and this is the whole foundation of natural magic.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The third order of elements is foremost and by themselves not elements but rather compounded from each other, varied, and multilayered and changing between themselves. They are the infallible middle, and therefore they are called the middle nature, or the soul of the middle nature. Indeed, there are few who understand this profound mystery.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    In these, by certain numbers, degrees, and orders, is the consummation of all effects in whatever things are natural, celestial, or supercelestial. They are full of wonders and mysteries and can operate in magic as well as with the natural and the divine. Indeed, through the [threefold nature], all things are bound, dissolved, and changed; there is knowledge and prediction of the future, the destruction of evil daemons, and the connection with good spirits after their descent.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, without the triplicities of the elements and the understanding of them, no one can confidently work in the occult sciences of magic and nature. But whoever can learn to reduce impurity into purity, multiplicity into simplicity, and also discernibly know nature, virtue, strength in number, and degree and order without dividing substance,
    will easily possess the knowledge of all natural things and perfect operation of celestial secrets.#t_footnote(70)[2]

    Chapter 5. Of the wonderful natures of fire and earth.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    For all wonderful operations, said Hermes, two are sufficient: fire and earth. Earth is passive, and fire is active.#t_footnote(71)[1] Fire, as Dionysius said, is in everything, and through everything it comes and goes brightly. It is in anything that is bright and is likewise secret and unknown when it is alone with no other matter approaching it in which it may be known by its own action. It is immense and invisible, and its own action is by its own power. Fire is moveable, handing itself over in a certain manner to all that approaches it; renewing, protecting nature; enveloping with brilliant light, incomprehensible, clear; discrete, recoiling; bringing up, moving sharply, elevated, not accepting servile indignities, always moving and moving others; comprehending the incomprehensible, not needing another, secretly rising from itself; accepts materials, revealing themselves to its magnitude, active, powerful, and also invisibly present in all things.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Fire does not allow neglect, but is resolved, as if with a vengeance, it suddenly reduces in reasoning generally and individually, impalpable, not lessening, taking all riches into itself.#t_footnote(72)[2] Fire is the immense and shameless portion of things, as Pliny said, and there is some doubt whether it is greater in destroying or producing.#t_footnote(73)[3] Fire is singular in itself, and it penetrates through all things, as the Pythagoreans said. It widens in the sky, illuminating, but in the underworld, it narrows, dark and tormenting. In the middle shares from each; therefore, fire is singular in itself.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    It is received in many ways and in different things; it is distributed differently, as Cleanthes testified to Cicero. Therefore, the fire we use comes from other things.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    It is in stones, in which it is shaken out by a blow from iron. It is in earth, which smokes from digging. It is in water, which heats springs and wells. It is in the deep sea, which grows warm from being tossed by the winds. It is in air, which we often see growing hot. Each animal and all living [things] and vegetables are nourished by heat, and everything that lives survives because of enclosed heat.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The properties of heavenly fire are heat, which makes all things fertile, and light, which gives life to everything. The properties of infernal fire are a flame consuming all and darkness, which fills everything with barrenness. Therefore, the celestial and bright fire chases away daemons of darkness, and our [ignited] wood chases them away as well because there is a similarity, and this ignited wood is a vehicle of the more superior light.
  ]

    About this, Jesus said: “I am the light of the world,” which is the true fire, Father of Lights, from whom all good gifts come. He sends out a brilliant fire, sharing it first with the Sun and the remaining heavenly bodies; through them, as if they were middle instruments, the fire flows unto us. Therefore, as the daemons of darkness are stronger in the dark, it follows that good daemons, who are the angels of light, grow in light—not only from the divine, the Solar, and the celestial but also from our [common] fire.

    Hence, it was decided by the first wise founders of religion and ceremonies that prayers, sacred singing, and consecrations shall not happen without kindled lights. For this reason, the Pythagorean Symbols said: “Do not speak to God without a light.” They ordered that lights be kindled to drive away evil daemons from the corpses of the dead and that the fires not be removed until sacred rites of atonement were completed and the corpses put away in the earth. The Almighty Himself required that all sacrifices be offered with fire and that the fire always be burning on the altar.#t_footnote(74)[4] Also at one time the Roman Vestal priestesses continuously watched over and guarded their fire.#t_footnote(75)[5]

    Of all the elements, the base and foundation is earth. Indeed, it is the object, subject, and receptacle of the influences of all celestial rays. It holds seeds in itself and the seminal virtues of all things. Therefore, it is said to be animal, vegetable, and mineral. It is made fruitful from all the remaining elements and celestials, and everything is generated from it.#t_footnote(76)[6] It receives all fertility and is like the first parent and spring of everything.#t_footnote(77)[7] Earth is the center, foundation, and mother of all.#t_footnote(78)[8]

    Take something from [earth], washed, purified, and subtle: if left for some time under the sky, soon the celestial virtues make it fertile and pregnant. From this, plants are produced, then worms, animals, small stones, and bright sparkling metal. There are great secrets in earth. If it is ever purified through the method of fire, it is reduced to its simplicity through a harmonious washing;#t_footnote(79)[9] it is the first material of our creation and the truest medicine that restores and preserves us.#t_footnote(80)[10]

  #p_normal[
    The remaining two elements are no less powerful—these being water and air—nor do their natures cease working wonders. Indeed, water is so necessary that without it no animal can live and no herbs or plants can sprout forth without first being moistened with water.#t_footnote(81)[1] It is the seminal virtue of all things: first in animals, whose seed is distinctly watery, and also the seeds of fruit and herbs, although they are [more] earthy. Yet it is necessary to dissolve in the water, if they should be fruitful—or if they absorb the moisture in the earth, or dew, or rain, or water added on purpose.

  #p_normal[
    Accordingly, Moses said that only water and earth produce a living soul; but water has a twofold production—that is, things swimming in water and flying in air over the earth. Also, the same scripture testifies that earthy production is partially indebted to water, saying that after creation the brush and plants did not grow because “God did not cause it to rain over the earth.”

    This element is of such great power that spiritual regeneration cannot happen without water, as Christ himself testified to Nicodemus.#t_footnote(82)[2] It likewise has great power in religion, expiations, and purifications and is no less necessary than fire. Its usefulness is infinite and many, and all things stand from its power, as well as generate, feed, and increase in strength. Thus, Thales of Miletus and Hesiod decided that water was the first of all things, older than all the other elements, and even more powerful,#t_footnote(83)[3] because it commands all the others. Indeed, as Pliny said, water devours earth, quenches flame, climbs high, is held in the clouds claiming the heavens as its own, and then falls to earth causing all things to grow.#t_footnote(84)[4] There are innumerable wonders of water written by Pliny, Solinus#t_footnote(85)[5] and many other historical descriptions.

    Additionally, Josephus referred to a certain river between Arcea and Raphanea, cities in Syria, that has a strange nature.

    Pausanias says that in Lyceus, the mountain of Arcadia, there was a spring called Agria, which, whenever a dryness of the region threatened to ruin the crops, the priest of Lycaean Zeus came after a victim was sacrificed and adored the spring with sacred prayers. He held an oak branch in his hand and lowered it into the bottom of the sacred spring. Then, with the water excited, vapor arose into the air and aroused the clouds. The assembling clouds spread over the entire sky, and somewhat later relaxed into rain, and the entire region was well irrigated.#t_footnote(90)[10] However, the physician Rufus of Ephesus,#t_footnote(91)[11] more than any other authority, wrote of the miraculous wonders of water, which, as far as I know, are found in no other authority.

    It remains that I speak about air. This is a vital spirit. It passes through everything that exists, providing all life and substance. It binds, moves, and fills all. Hence, Hebrew teachers did not consider it among the elements, but as the middle and adhesive connecting different things together and, as it were, the resounding spirit of the world’s instrument.#t_footnote(92)[12] Indeed, it is nearest to all celestial influences and accordingly contains and shares them with the other elements and then mixes with each one.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Air is also no less important to all things that are natural, as well as to artificial things and speeches of whatever kind. As if it were a divine mirror, it accepts and restrains them and carries them off with itself. In human and animal bodies it enters their pores, nevertheless impressing [its qualities on them] while asleep or awake. It provides the matter for miraculous foreboding and divinatory dreams.#t_footnote(93)[13]

  #p_normal[
    They also say that when someone happens to walk by a place where a man was killed or even a recently hidden corpse, he is quickly moved with dread and fear. This is because the air in that place is full of a horrible type of homicide. The spirit of a man then breathes it in and is affected by disturbances of a similar type, from which fear takes hold: for anything that makes a sudden impression confounds nature.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Many philosophers believe that air is the cause of dreams and many other impressions of the soul by applying images, likenesses, or appearances#t_footnote(94)[14] that are detached from things and speeches that multiply in the air, until they come to the senses, and then to the imagination where the soul receives them—that is, it is freed of cares and is unimpeded. Appearances of this kind will not wait, and they shape the soul. Indeed, the appearances of things, although they are carried toward the senses of men and animals according to their own nature, are yet from the heavens. While they are in the air, they acquire some impression, and according to aptitude and disposition, they can be brought more to the senses of one, rather than to another.#t_footnote(95)[15]

    Hence, it is possibly natural and far from all superstition—with no other spirit intervening—for one man to be able to announce their mind to another man living in another place, regardless of whether the length or distance from him is known. This is possible to do in a short time, even if that time cannot be precisely measured, although it is necessary to be within twenty-four hours. I have learned how to do this and have often done it, as has the Abbot Trithemius.#t_footnote(96)[16]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    There are also some images not only spiritual but also natural that influence things by a certain influence through bodies from bodies. [Those images] grow strong in air, then through light, then through motion, then to vision, then to the other senses. They can offer and show and reveal miracles to us, as Plotinus proved and taught.#t_footnote(97)[17]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    We see how, in the south wind, air thickens into thin clouds in which images of distant fortresses, mountains, horses, men, and other things are reflected, as if in a mirror, then vanish when the clouds depart.#t_footnote(98)[18] Aristotle showed in #emph[Meteorology] that some rainbows are conceived in a cloud of air as if it were a mirror. Albertus said: “The effigies of bodies from the natural power of humid air are easily fashioned in the same way, so that the images of things are in [other] things.” Aristotle said that a man had a certain debility of vision where the air around him became like a mirror and the optical rays reflected toward him could not penetrate. From whichever direction he went, his image was opposite, and he saw his own face in front of him.#t_footnote(99)[19]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Similarly, in the art of some mirrors, any image you wish can be produced in the air far away from the mirror. An ignorant man will think he sees daemons or shadowy souls, yet they are nothing but a certain likeness related to them and without any life. It is well known that if a ray of sunlight enters a dark place free of all light through a small hole with a piece of white paper or a plain mirror placed under it, one can see whatever is illuminated by the Sun.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    There is another astonishing illusion, where if certain artificial images are painted or letters written and placed opposite the rays of the full Moon on a clear night, their likeness is snatched up and multiplied in the air and reflected back with the Lunar rays. If some other person sees this from a long distance, they can read and recognize them in the disk or circle of the Moon. Indeed, this art of reporting secrets is very useful for besieged villages and cities, a practice Pythagoras frequently#t_footnote(100)[20] engaged in, known today by some and also to me.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Yet all of these and many more are in the foundation of the nature of air and their reason is in mathematics and optics. Just as these likenesses are reflected back toward sight, there are also some for hearing, detected as an echo. But there are more hidden arts, such as the ability to hear from remote distances and the ability to understand what another whispers even in secrecy.

    Also from the element of air are winds: indeed, they are nothing more than rapidly moving air. Of these there are four principles, blowing from the four directions of the sky. These [four] are Notus from the south, Boreas from the north, Zephyrus from the west, and Apeliotes#t_footnote(101)[21] or Eurus from the east, which Pontanus included in these two verses: #emph[From the north is Boreas, indeed Notus blows Olympus,]
  ]
  #p_poetry[
    #emph[Zephyrus has the west, from the east comes Eurus.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Notus is the southern wind, cloudy and moist, warm and sickly. Jerome called it the cupbearer of rain. Ovid thus described: #emph[. . . the south wind flies with dripping wings,]

  #p_normal[
    After the four simple elements follow the four kinds of perfect compounds, which are stones, metals, plants, and animals. Although each is generated from all of the elements compounded together, they follow and imitate a particular single element. All stones are earthy, since their nature is heavy and falling, and thus solid with dryness,#t_footnote(107)[1] and are unable to melt. Metal is from water and dissolvable (which natural philosophers confess, and alchemists prove) because they are a viscous water, or because they are generated from watery quicksilver. Plants agree with air, since unless they are under the sky, they will not sprout or coalesce. Thus, also in all animals, #emph[Fire is their power and their heavenly source,#t_footnote(108)[2]]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    and fire has such an affinity to them that if it is extinguished life will entirely fail.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Again, each of these types of things is distinguished by the degrees of the elements. For instance, among stones, which are called earthy and especially dark and heavy, there are some that are watery because they are transparent and thickened because of water, such as crystal, beryl, and pearls in conches. Some are airy because they float on the top of the water and are spongy, such as the sponge stone#t_footnote(109)[3] and pumice and tophus.#t_footnote(110)[4] There are some that are fiery, because they are extracted from fire or are resolved or generated from it, such as lightning stones, pyrites, and asbestos.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Similarly, among metals, lead and silver are earthy, quicksilver is watery, copper and tin are airy, and certainly gold and iron are fiery.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Likewise, in plants, roots imitate earth because of their density, but leaves imitate water because of their juice, flowers after air because of their fineness, and seeds after fire because of their generative spirit. Additionally, some are called hot, some cold, some moist, and others dry, and they borrow their names from the qualities of the elements.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Among animals, there are some earthly ones that stand out from the others, because they live in the heart of the earth, such as vermin, worms, moles, and many reptiles. Others are watery, such as fish. Others are airy and are unable to live outside of the air. Some are fiery, inhabiting fire, such as the salamander and some cicadas (which are called
    #emph[pyraustae]),#t_footnote(111)[5] and others who boil with a certain heat, such as pigeons, ostriches, and lions,#t_footnote(112)[6] which the #emph[Book of Wisdom] calls “beasts that breathe with a fiery vapor.”#t_footnote(113)[7] Additionally, in animals, bones refer to earth, flesh to air, the vital spirit to fire, and the humors to water. These also share from the elements: for red#t_footnote(114)[8] cholera belongs to fire, blood is air, phlegm is water, and black bile is earth. Finally, in the soul itself, as Augustine testified, the intellect refers to fire, reason to air, imagination to water, and indeed the senses to earth. Also [the senses] are distributed together among the elements: for vision is fiery, for it cannot perceive without fire and light. Hearing is airy, for sound is made from striking the air. Smell and taste refer to water, for without moisture neither smell nor taste happens. Finally, touch is entirely earthy, as it receives dense bodies for itself.#t_footnote(115)[9] Likewise, the elements guide the actions and operations of man. Indeed, slow and dense motion is signified by earth; fear, ignorance, and relaxed operations by water; a cheerful and friendly character by air; sharp impetuosity and anger by fire.#t_footnote(116)[10]

    It is the unanimous opinion of all Platonists that, as in the archetype of the world all things are in all,#t_footnote(117)[1] so also all things in the corporeal world are in all.

    In these inferior [bodies], the elements are of certain dense forms: heavy matter and the material elements.

    In the heavens, the elements have their [own] natures and virtues—that is, with a heavenly and more excellent manner than the sublunary.

  #p_normal[
    Among the signs, some are fiery, some are earthy, some are airy, some are watery. The four elements rule the triplicities of the heavens, distributing each element to the first, the middle, and end. Thus, the first for the fiery [triplicity] is Aries, progressing and increasing to Leo, and finally to Sagittarius. The first earthy [triplicity] is Taurus, progressing to Virgo, and last to Capricorn. The first airy [triplicity] is Gemini, progressing to Libra, and ending in Aquarius. The first watery [triplicity] is Cancer, the middle is Scorpio, and Pisces has the end.#t_footnote(121)[5]

    According to this reasoning, daemons are distinguished from each other. As such, some are called fiery, others earthy, others airy, and others watery.#t_footnote(122)[6] Hence there are the four infernal rivers: fiery Phlegethon, airy Cocytus, watery Styx, and earthy Acheron.#t_footnote(123)[7]

    Also, the elements are placed over the angels of the universe and the blessed intelligences. Indeed, the essence of stability is in them—an earthy virtue, in which is the firm seat of God; also their pious mercy, a [kind of] watery cleansing virtue.#t_footnote(130)[14] Hence the Psalms spoke of water, where it says of the heavens: “you cover its heights with water.”#t_footnote(131)[15] Also in them is air, the subtle spirit, love, and a shining fire.

    The virtues of some natural things are elemental—such as to heat, to cool, to moisten, and to dry—and these operations are called primary and secondary actions. Indeed, these are the only qualities that entirely change the whole substance, because none of the other qualities can do this. However, some [qualities] belong to things compounded from elements. These are greater than the primary qualities, as they are of ripening, digesting, loosening, softening, hardening, constricting, purging, corroding, combusting, opening, evaporating, strengthening, soothing, binding, blocking, expelling, retaining, attracting, reflecting, stupefying, bestowing, lubricating, and many others.

    Indeed, elemental qualities do many things when mixed that they cannot do by themselves. These operations are called secondary qualities, because they follow the nature and measure of the mixtures of the first virtues, as is eloquently discussed in medical books. [For example,] ripening is an operation of natural heat according to a certain measure in the substance of matter, and hardening is an operation of cold, such as freezing and the like.

    These operations sometimes act upon a determined member, such as provoking urine, milk, or menstruation. These are called the third qualities, which follow the second as the second follows the first.

    Men greatly admire many things that are artificially made—such as fire that burns in waters, which they call Greek Fire—the many compositions of which Aristotle taught in his treatise on that [subject] alone. In a similar way, it often happens that fire is extinguished by oil and is kindled when cold water is sprinkled on it, and fire that is kindled by rain, wind, or the Sun. There is made a fire called burning water, the composition of which is well known, that will consume nothing except itself. Also, there are made inextinguishable fires, incombustible oils, and everlasting lamps that may not be extinguished by wind, water, or any other method. These would be thought of as completely incredible, except there was a famous lamp that once shone in the temple of Venus, in which the stone asbestos burned. When [the lamp] was kindled, it could never be extinguished.#t_footnote(141)[2]

    On the other hand, wood or some other combustibles can be prepared so that fire cannot harm them.

These virtues, because they have many forms, can therefore do much with little matter. But an elemental virtue, because it is material, uses more to act, and also needs more matter.#t_footnote(146)[3]

    There are, in things we recognize, certain other innate virtues beyond the elemental qualities created by nature, which we admire and often amaze us, though we may not know or rarely see [such things], such as the phoenix,#t_footnote(148)[5] the only bird that renews itself, of which we read in Ovid:

    Matreas once brought a great wonder to the Greeks and the Romans.

Also [wonderful are] the singing stones about which Pausanias#t_footnote(155)[12] wrote. All of these works are occult virtues.

  ]
  #p_normal[
    According to Platonists, all inferior ideas come from superior Ideas.#t_footnote(161)[1]
    They define an Idea as a form above bodies, souls, minds; singular, simple, pure; unchangeable, indivisible, incorporeal, and eternal. The nature of all Ideas is the same.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But they placed ideas in the Good itself—that is, with God— through the manner of cause. They are only distinguished from each other by certain relative reasons, or else whatever is in the world shall be one thing without variety, yet they agree with each other in essence, or else God would be a multiple substance. In the second place, is the intelligible—that is, the World Soul—through their own forms and absolute superior forms; they are different from each other.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Thus, all Ideas in God are indeed one form, but in the World Soul, they are many. They are then placed in minds (or connected with bodies, or separate from bodies) with a certain participation, and by degrees, they are distinguished more and more. They are placed in nature as a certain inferior seed of forms infused by Ideas, and they are finally placed in matter as shadows.#t_footnote(162)[2] In addition to this, there are as many seminal reasons of things in the World Soul as there are ideas in the Divine Mind. For this reason, it built figures in the heavens above the stars and impressed into them all of its qualities.#t_footnote(163)[3] Therefore these figures, qualities, and all inferior kinds of virtues depend upon these stars. Thus, as every species has a celestial figure appropriate to it, from which comes a wonderful power of operation,#t_footnote(164)[4] and through the seminal method of the World Soul, it receives a gift from its own Idea.#t_footnote(165)[5]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed, Ideas are not only the essential causes of any species but are also the causes of every virtue belonging to such species. This is what many philosophers say because of a certain virtue—that is, having a certain and stable reason not accidental or casual, but effective, powerful and unfailing, nothing frustrated, doing nothing in vain, and moving virtues that exist in natural things.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed, these virtues, which are the operations of Ideas, do not err unless by accident—that is, from impurities and the inequality of matter. In this way, things are found more or less powerful in the same species according to the purity or confusion of matter. Indeed, all celestial influences can hinder through the confusion and unfitness of matter.#t_footnote(166)[6] About this, there is a Platonic proverb [that says]: the merits of matter are infused by the celestial virtues, and which Virgil remembered in his poem:
  ]
  #p_poetry[
    #emph[Fire is their power and their heavenly source]
  ]
  #p_poetry[
    #emph[As great harmful bodies do not hinder them.#t_footnote(167)[7]]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Whereby those things that are less immersed in the material Idea—that is, taking a greater similarity with [things] that are separate—have powerful virtues in operating, like an operation of a separated Idea. Therefore, we know that the placement and figure of the celestials are the cause of all noble virtues that are in more inferior species.#t_footnote(168)[8]

  ]
  #p_normal[
    There are singular individuals and many gifts that are as remarkable as in the [entire] species, which are also from the figures of the heavens and stars.#t_footnote(169)[1] Indeed all individuals, when they start [life] under a determined horoscope#t_footnote(170)[2] and celestial constellation,#t_footnote(171)[3] assemble with certain extraordinary virtues of labor and suffering, a wondrous thing. And they also receive [virtues] from their species, through celestial influences,#t_footnote(172)[4] and then through the obedience of generated matter and from the World Soul. Such is the quality of the obedience of our bodies and souls. Indeed, we see this in ourselves, because to whatever form we conceive, we move our body with delight, horror, or fear; then frequently heavenly souls, when diversely conceived, matter obediently moves toward them.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Also, many prodigies appear in nature from the imagination of superior motions; and likewise, different virtues that are in no way natural things, but are conceived artificial things, especially if the soul of the operator strives to the same. About this, Avicenna said: “Whatever is made must preexist before the motion and conception of the stars and orbs.”#t_footnote(173)[5]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Thus, the various effects of things, inclinations, and customs are not only disposed from various materials, as most suppose, but also from the influence of various and diverse forms—indeed not specific differences, but particular and individual. And these degrees are variously distributed by God the First Cause, “who distributes the rest to each as He wishes.” Yet He cooperates with the second causes, the angelic, and celestial, disposing corporeal matter and connecting all other things.#t_footnote(174)[6] Therefore, God infuses all virtues through the World Soul, yet by a particular virtue of images and presiding intelligences, the coursing rays and the aspects of the stars, and a certain agreeing harmony.#t_footnote(175)[7]

If their time is extended, the gods themselves would not be spared.#t_footnote(197)[22]

    However, from where these virtues come, no one has explained, but many remarkable volumes have been produced about the qualities of these things—not even Hermes, Bacchus, Aaron, Orpheus, Theophrastus, Thabit, Zenothemas, Zoroaster, Evax, Dioscorides, Isaac the Jew, Zacharias the Babylonian, Albertus, or Arnaldus. Yet all of them admit, which Zacharias and Mithridates wrote, that great power and human fate are in the virtues of stones and herbs.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, [to know] from where these come requires a higher speculation. Alexander the Peripatetic supposed, not departing from his senses and qualities, that they came from the elements and their qualities: which is perhaps true if the qualities are of the same type, but there are many operations of stones, and not of the same type or kind.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Consequently, the Academy together with Plato attributed these virtues to Ideas, the fashioner#t_footnote(198)[23] of things. But Avicenna reduced these operations to intelligences, Hermes to the stars, and Albertus to the specific forms of things. Although these authorities saw each other as adversaries, none of them—if correctly understood—departed from the truth, since all spoke to the same effect in most respects.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed, God is the primary beginning and end of all virtues. His attendants, the intelligences, administer the seal of the Ideas—who, as faithful executors, seal each thing they believe to be an ideal virtue. Meanwhile, the heavens and stars as instruments dispose the matter for receiving those forms that reside in the Divine Majesty (as Plato said in the
    #emph[Timaeus]) and are carried by the stars. Then the Giver of Forms distributes them through the ministry of his intelligences, which He placed as rulers and guardians over his works to whom he entrusted the faculty in things, such as the virtue of all stones, herbs, metals and all other things that are from the presiding intelligences.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, form and virtue emerge first from the Ideas, then from the presiding and ruling intelligences, then from the aspects set in the heavens, and finally from the elements disposing the complexion of the corresponding celestial influences, from which the elements themselves are disposed. Therefore, these sorts of operations are managed in more inferior things through distinct forms, but in the heavens by disposing virtues; in the intelligences through mediating reason; in the Archetype through Ideas and exemplary forms. All of these must agree to bring about the effect and virtue of each thing.#t_footnote(199)[24]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    There is a virtue and wonderful operation in each herb and stone, but more so in the stars, which are beyond even the presiding intelligences that provide many things. [Such things come] especially from the Supreme Cause, to whom everything mutually, perfectly, and concordantly corresponds with a harmonious song, as if it were a certain hymn always praising the highest Maker. [It is] just as [in scripture, when] the holy children in the Chaldean furnace were encouraged to sing: “Praise the Lord of all things that grow in the Earth and all that moves in the water, and all the birds in the sky, beasts and cattle and the sons of men.”#t_footnote(200)[25]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore there is no cause for necessary effects other than all things connected with the First Cause corresponding to the divine model and eternal ideas, from where each thing has its limit in their particular archetypal place and from where it lives and draws its origin: and every virtue of herbs, stones, metals, animals, words, prayers and all that exists are implanted by God. Although operated by the intelligences in these inferiors, sometimes God omits these intermediaries (or suspends their duties) and immediately accomplishes this Himself. [Such acts of God] are called miracles. The authority of the First Cause and the rank of the Second Cause (which Plato and others call handmaids) necessarily drive and produce their effects. Yet, sometimes God by His pleasure frees or suspends them, that they shall thoroughly stop their necessary command and rank: and these are the greatest miracles of God.

    Thus, the fire in the Chaldean’s furnace did not consume the children; thus, by Joshua’s command the Sun receded from its course for the space of one day; thus, from the petition of Hezekiah it receded for ten degrees, or ten hours; and thus from the suffering of Christ the full Moon darkened the Sun.#t_footnote(201)[26] In the accounts of these operations, no rational discourse, no magic, no great occult or profound science can investigate or attain. They are only learned about and inquired into by divine oracles.

    Chapter 14. Of what the World Spirit is and how it binds occult virtues.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Democritus, Orpheus, and many Pythagoreans carefully studied the celestial virtues and inferior natures, saying that all things are full of gods:#t_footnote(202)[1] not without cause, since there is nothing that is of such excellent virtue and devoid of divine assistance that it is content with its own nature.#t_footnote(203)[2] But they called divine virtues in a variety of things “gods,” which Zoroaster called “false gods” and Synesius called “symbolic allurements.”#t_footnote(204)[3] Others called them “living,” and still others called them “souls.” The qualities of things were said to depend on these virtues, because it is only the soul that operates by extending from one matter out to many things around it, as in man who extends his intellect to the intelligible, and his imagination to the imaginable.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    This is what they understood: that the soul of one being moves and advances to the other and bewitches it so that its operations are impeded, like a diamond impedes a lodestone so that it cannot attract iron.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    It is true that the soul is the #emph[Primum Mobile,]#t_footnote(205)[4] moving by its own will.#t_footnote(206)[5] However, the body or matter is unable to move by itself, and if separated from the soul will degenerate. Therefore, they consider the operation more excellent with a medium (such as something that was almost not a body but now almost a soul, or something that is almost not a soul but now almost a body) so that clearly the soul is connected to the body.#t_footnote(207)[6]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    They imagine that such a medium is the World Spirit, which is what we call the quintessence,#t_footnote(208)[7] because it is not from the four elements but is a certain fifth, subsisting above and beyond them. Therefore, in such a spirit, it is necessary to require a medium for celestial souls to belong to dense bodies and grant wonderful gifts.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed, this spirit is close to what is in the body of the world, as is what is in our human bodies. In the same way as the virtues of our souls are applied to the members [of our bodies], the virtues of the World Soul are extended to everything by the quintessence. Nothing is found in the entire universe that is without a spark of its virtue. It is greatly, and indeed most greatly, infused into those things that have drawn the most from the spirit;#t_footnote(209)[8] drawing from the stellar rays, inasmuch as things make themselves conform to them.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, this spirit propagates all occult qualities in herbs, stones, metals, and animals through the Sun, the Moon, the planets, and the stars above the planets. However, this spirit can be more useful to us if one understands how to remove it from the other elements, or at least use those things that are most abundant with this spirit. Accordingly, these things, where the spirit is less immersed into the body and less confined to matter, act more powerfully and perfectly, and also more readily generate their like: for in them are all generative and seminal virtues.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    For this reason, alchemists try to separate spirit from gold and silver. When they are duly removed and extracted, if afterward there was any matter of the same kind, this was added to any metal. [By doing this,] gold and silver were immediately made.#t_footnote(210)[9] We have learned how to make this and have sometimes seen it but were not able to make more gold, unless it was the same weight as that from which the spirit was extracted. Since spirit is an extending form and not contracting,#t_footnote(211)[10] it cannot change an imperfect body into a perfect one beyond its measure. I will not deny this, yet it might be possible by a different art.

  #p_normal[
    It is well known that the qualities of occult things are not from elemental natures but are engrafted by the heavens, hidden from our senses, and in fact, scarcely understood by our reason.#t_footnote(212)[1] Indeed, these [qualities] are from the World Spirit through the stellar rays, which we cannot investigate except by experience and conjecture. From where, you who are anxious to feign effort into this study must consider this because each thing moves and turns to its like and inclines according to all of its abilities and qualities; that is, in occult virtue, as well as in quality, and of course, elemental virtue. It is also always in the substance itself, as we see in salt: for whatever stands for long in salt, becomes salt.#t_footnote(213)[2]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed, every agent when it begins to act does not move towards an inferior of itself, but as long as it can, [the inferior] will be made equal and agreeable to it. We also clearly see this in sensible animals, in which the nutritive virtue of food does not change into herbs or plants but into sensible flesh.#t_footnote(214)[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, in those things where there is an excess of any qualities or properties, such as heat, cold, boldness, fear, sadness, anger, love, hatred, or any other passion or virtue (whether if it belongs to itself by nature, or sometimes by skill or chance, such as the boldness of a prostitute), these things move and provoke such a great quality, passion, and virtue. Thus, fire moves to fire and water moves to water and boldness moves to boldness.

    It is well known by physicians that the brain helps the brain and the lungs help the lungs.#t_footnote(215)[4] They say that if the eye of a frog is suspended from around the neck in a cloth in the original color it will cure eye inflammations: the right eye for the right, and the left for the left.#t_footnote(216)[5] The same is said about crabs for the eyes. Likewise, the feet of a tortoise were collected for gout and bound suspended [upon the body of the afflicted individual] feet to feet, hand to hand, right to right, left to left. They said in the same way that all barren animals#t_footnote(217)[6] provoke sterility, and to especially use their testicles and womb or urine. If [these are] given to a woman and she takes it or if something is infused with it, she will not conceive for an entire month.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, if we wish to work with some quality or virtue, we must search for an animal or other thing that belongs to such an excellent quality and from this take the part in which such a quality or virtue especially thrives. For instance, if we wish to promote love, we search for some animal that especially loves, which are pigeons, turtledoves,#t_footnote(218)[7] sparrows, swallows, and wagtails. From these, we take the members or parts whose strength has the greatest venereal appetite, which are the heart, testicles, womb, penis, sperm, and menses. This must happen at a time when that animal is most affected by captivation and intensity;#t_footnote(219)[8] indeed, then they greatly provoke and draw love. Likewise, for increasing boldness, we must search for a lion or rooster from whom we take the heart, eyes, or forehead.#t_footnote(220)[9]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Thus, we must understand what Psellus the Platonist said, that dogs, ravens,#t_footnote(221)[10] and roosters are good for watching. Also, nightingales, bats, and owls have the best heads, hearts, and eyes.#t_footnote(222)[11]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, they said, “If you carry the heart of a raven or a bat about you, you will not feel sleepy until it is discarded.” The same is true of the head of a bat that is dried and bound to the right arm of someone who is awake: for if it was placed while sleeping, they will not wake until it is discarded.#t_footnote(223)[12]

  #p_normal[
    In the same way, frogs and horned owls make one talkative, and of these especially is the tongue and the heart. Thus, the tongue of a water frog placed under the head makes one talk in their sleep.#t_footnote(224)[13] The heart of a horned owl placed under the left breast of a sleeping woman will cause the effect of pronouncing all secrets. Also, the same effect happens when the heart of a small owl and the fat of a hare are placed over the breast of someone sleeping.#t_footnote(225)[14]

  #p_normal[
    In the same way, all animals who are long-lived confer long life, and whatever can renew their life grants renewal of life to our bodies and restores youth, which physicians have shown to accept many times, and is shown in vipers and serpents. It is well known that stags renew their old age by consuming serpents.#t_footnote(226)[15] In the same way, the phoenix renews by a fire that it makes for itself.#t_footnote(227)[16] And a similar virtue is in the pelican, whose right foot if placed under warm dung, a pelican will be born from it after three months.#t_footnote(228)[17]

    According to this, it is said that a public prostitute, who exudes boldness and shamelessness, affects everything near her with these qualities, which are then transferred to others.

The same is also said with weasels and rings, [because] it is agreed that if weasels’ eyes are plucked out with a point their vision will be restored again.#t_footnote(237)[6] In the same manner, rings are placed at certain times in the nests of sparrows or swallows, which afterward are used for love or favor.

    Thus, in the elements, fire is against water and air is against earth. But [fire and air, and water and earth] agree with each other. Again, in the heavens, Saturn is friendly to Mercury, Jupiter, the Sun, and Moon but unfriendly to Mars and Venus. Jupiter is friendly with all the planets except Mars. Thus, all the planets except Venus are enemies with Mars. The Sun loves Jupiter and Venus, and is an enemy to Mars, Mercury, and the Moon. All [of the planets] except Saturn love Venus. Mercury is friendly with Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn, and is an enemy with the Sun, Moon, and Mars. However, the Moon is friendly with Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, and enemies with Mars and Mercury.

  #p_normal[
    There is another enmity among the stars—that is, when they have opposite houses, such as Saturn toward the luminaries, Jupiter toward Mercury, and Mars toward Venus. That enmity is stronger in [those planets] whose exaltations are opposite to theirs, such as Saturn with the Sun, Jupiter with Mars, and Venus with Mercury. However, the strongest friendships are those of a harmonious nature, quality, substance, and power, such as Mars with the Sun and Venus with the Moon, likewise Jupiter with Venus.

    In a similar manner, ants flee from the heart of a hoopoe,#t_footnote(350)[16] and not from the head, feet, or eyes.

Also, a nightingale’s flesh bound in the skin of a deer is excellent for staying awake and keeping sleep away.#t_footnote(365)[8] Similarly, the ray of a stingray#t_footnote(366)[9] bound to the navel makes easier childbirths.

  #p_normal[
    It is truly very difficult to
    understand which star or sign a thing is under. Yet they are understood through
    the imitation of their rays, movement, or figure of the superiors. Some are also
    [understood] by colors and scents, some also through the effects of their operations agreeing with certain stars.#t_footnote(398)[1]

    Among stones, however, are those with golden drops that imitate the Sun’s rays, such as the stone aetite, which has a virtue against falling sickness and poison. Also, the stone that is called the “eye of the Sun”#t_footnote(401)[4] has a figure similar to the pupil of an eye, and from its center, it emits a ray#t_footnote(402)[5] that strengthens the brain and sharpens#t_footnote(403)[6] the eye. The carbuncle shines at night and has a virtue against all airy and vaporous poisons. The stone chrysolite is weak in color and a clear green. When placed opposite the Sun, it emits a golden star. It strengthens the spirit and helps asthma; when [chrysolite is] pierced, the hole being filled with the hairs of an ass and bound to the left arm, it chases away phantasms and melancholy terrors as well as repels follies.#t_footnote(404)[7] The stone iris, similar in color to the crystal, is frequently found as a hexagon. When under a roof, and part of it placed opposite the rays of the Sun, and the other part held in the shadow, it collects the Sun’s rays into itself. It then projects the reflection, making a rainbow appear on the opposite wall.#t_footnote(405)[8] Likewise, the stone heliotrope, green in the manner of a jasper or emerald with starry red drops, makes one constant, glorious, and famous and brings long life. It also has a wondrous virtue that if it is in the Sun’s rays, it is said to change into blood—that is, it appears to be like blood as if the Sun suffered an eclipse; evidently when it is anointed with the juice of the herb of the same name and placed in a vessel filled with water. There is another more wondrous virtue in the eyes of men, which offends the sight and blinds the vision so that it will not permit men to see those who bear it;#t_footnote(406)[9]
    yet it does not happen without the help of the herb of the same name, which is
    also called heliotrope—that is, following the Sun. These virtues were confirmed in the writings of Albertus Magnus and William of Auvergne.#t_footnote(407)[10]

Albertus testified that Asclepius wrote this in one of his letters about Octavian Augustus: that this poison was so cold that the heart of a man is preserved from death by burning. Thus, if it is placed in fire for some time it is changed to stone. [For this reason], it is called
    #emph[pyrophilos:] “from fire.” It has a wonderful virtue against poison, and it renders the bearer ambitious and formidable against adversaries.#t_footnote(411)[14] But above everything that is Solar is the stone called the
    #emph[pantaura,] which is said to have been found by Apollonius.#t_footnote(412)[15] It draws other stones to itself, like lodestones with iron, and is effective against all poisons.#t_footnote(413)[16] Others call it
    #emph[pantherus] because it has spots like the leopard.#t_footnote(414)[17] Likewise is the [stone] called
    #emph[panthocras,]#t_footnote(415)[18] which contains all colors.

Also, the peony, swallow-wort, citrus, ginger, gentian, dittany, and verbena are likewise excellent for prophecy, atonement, and chasing away evil daemons.#t_footnote(421)[24] The laurel is sacred to Phoebus,#t_footnote(422)[25] as are the cedar, palm, ash tree, ivy, and vine—and this goes for any plant that repels poison and lightning, is ever-green, and does not fear the cold of winter.

Among stones they preside over crystals and #emph[diodoeo;]#t_footnote(599)[11] among plants #emph[diacedon],#t_footnote(600)[12] frankincense, and fennel; and over metals quicksilver. Third, Aldebaran has among stones carbuncles and rubies, and among planets spurge and woodruff.#t_footnote(601)[13] Fourth is called the Goat.#t_footnote(602)[14] It has among stones sapphire; among plants horehound—[also called] #emph[prasium]—mint, mugwort, and mandrake. Fifth is Canis Major. It has among stones beryl, [among plants] savin juniper, mugwort, and dragonwort and among animals the serpent’s tongue. Sixth, Canis Minor, has among stones agates, and among plants is heliotrope flowers and pennyroyal. Seventh, the Heart of the Lion,#t_footnote(603)[15] has among stones garnet#t_footnote(604)[16] and among plants swallow-wort with mugwort and mastic. Eighth is the tail of Ursa Minor, and it has among stones the magnetic lodestone; among plants chicory, the leaves and flowers of which turn toward the north, mugwort, and periwinkle flower; and among animals the tooth of a wolf. The ninth is called Raven’s Wing,#t_footnote(605)[17] who has among stones onyx (black); among plants the greater burdock (the four-cornered kind),#t_footnote(606)[18] henbane, and comfrey; and among animals the tongue of a frog. The tenth, Spica, has among stones emeralds; among plants sage, trefoil, periwinkle or #emph[promarullam,]#t_footnote(607)[19] mugwort, and mandrake. The eleventh is called Alchameth,#t_footnote(608)[20] who has among stones the jasper and among plants the greater plantain.

    However, besides these, we must know that no stone, plant, animal, or other thing is ruled by only one star, but many. They also receive many influences, not separate, but together.

Emeralds are with Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, and Spica. Amethyst, according to Hermes, is under Mars with Jupiter and the Heart of the Scorpion. The many kinds of Jasper are under Mars, Jupiter, and the star Alchameth. Chrysolite is with the Sun, Venus, and Mercury, and the star that is called the Falling Vulture. Topaz is with the Sun and Elpheia. Diamond is with Mars and Caput Algol.

  #p_normal[
    All of the stars have their own natures, qualities, and conditions, whose rays produce seals and characters, even in inferior things—in elements, stones, plants, animals, and in members. From these, each thing obtains a harmonious disposition, and from its star shining upon it, some special seal or character is impressed upon it. Those stars or harmonies are significant and special, containing a virtue different from any other matter, type, species, or number.

  #p_quote[
    #emph[Each thing has its own character.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, everything has its character impressed upon it by its star for some singular effect—especially those stars that hold rulership above all others. These characters contain and retain their stars’ individual natures, virtues, roots, and similar operations in other things, upon which they reflect, provoke, and help the influence of their stars, planets or fixed stars, images, and celestial signs—that is, often in their appropriate material and time and made with appropriate ceremonies.#t_footnote(619)[1] Ancient wise men considered this, working hard to investigate the occult agreements in things: stellar images, figures, seals, sigils, and marked characters, which nature itself through the stellar rays painted onto more inferior things—some in stones, some in plants, the joints and knots of twigs, and some in different members of animals.

    For instance, laurel, lotus, and heliotrope are Solar plants. In their clipped roots and knots, they show their Solar characters. Thus, in animals, a kind of divination was created from their bones, shoulders, and shoulder blades. In stones and stone quarries, characters and celestial images are often there.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Since such great many things are not found in traditional knowledge, a few prudent people can perceive them. Therefore, leaving these investigations now in plants, stones, and other things, and the many animal members, we limit ourselves only to human nature. [Man] is the most complete image of the entire universe, containing in him all celestial harmony, and without a doubt abundantly discovers all of the seals and characters of the stars and celestial influences#t_footnote(620)[2]—which indeed is more effective, since he is less removed from celestial nature. However, as only God alone knows the number of stars, no human intellect can [completely] grasp their effects and seals upon more inferior things. Of these, very few have become known: those the ancient philosophers and chiromancers understood partially by reason and partially by experience. Thus, many natural treasures are closed and hidden.

    Now if you wish to accept a virtue from any part of the world or star, use that which the star holds under its particular influence, just as wood prepared with sulfur, pitch, and oil accepts flame. Nevertheless, when certain species or individual things (many of which are scattered) that conform to the same Idea and star are used correctly, suddenly through this appropriately prepared matter a singular gift is infused by reason of the World Soul. Now, when I say, “appropriately prepared,” [I mean] under a harmony similar to the harmony of the former virtue that was infused into the matter. Although we spoke about things having some virtues, those virtues are hidden because seldom do works from such virtues become visibly perfected.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    As a grain of mustard is bruised, its hidden sharpness is awakened, as the heat of a fire makes visible letters written in the juice of an onion or milk that were hidden earlier, as letters written on stone with the fat of a goat are absolutely hidden, when the stone is submerged in vinegar, they appear standing out as if they were prominently sculpted, as the touch of a broom or stick awakens a sleeper to madness.#t_footnote(624)[1] Thus, heavenly harmony is hidden and its material virtues are produced, awakened, strengthened, and its effects are manifest. Its power, as I say, is led into action when those things are duly exposed at the appropriate celestial time.

    For example, if you wish to attract a virtue from the Sun and search for Solar things among vegetables, plants, metal, stones, and animals, those things with the most power are higher in the Solar order.

  #p_normal[
    We have learned that in inferior nature, all gifts of superior bodies cannot be found enclosed in one certain thing but are dispersed among many kinds. For example, there are many Solar things, yet each one does not contain all of the Solar virtues. Different things have different Solar properties.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Because of this, it is sometimes necessary in operations to make mixtures, as if one hundred or one thousand Solar virtues were scattered among as many plants, animals, and the like. We can gather these similarities and reduce them into one form, where we will see these virtues contained into one whole.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Twofold virtue in mixtures.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However there is a twofold virtue in mixtures: one in which its parts were previously engrafted and is celestial, and the other is through specific and artificial combinations of many things mixed together according to certain proportions, such as with heavenly agreement, acquired under certain constellations.#t_footnote(626)[1] These virtues descend through the similarities and conditions of certain things toward each other with their superiors, inasmuch as following the preceding corresponding virtues by degree, where the receiver especially accommodates its giver above him.#t_footnote(627)[2]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Thus, from certain compositions of herbs, vapors, and the like, made with natural philosophy and then astronomy, results a common form endowed with the many gifts of the stars.#t_footnote(628)[3] This is similar to the honey of bees who remove the juice from innumerable flowers and reduce them into one form containing all of their virtues by a divine and admirable art. What is no less wonderful is the artificial honey reported by Eudoxus Gnidius, in which a certain tribe of giants in Libya learned how to make honey from flowers, which was very good and was seen as not very different from the honey from bees.#t_footnote(629)[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But all mixtures, which consist of many things, are most perfect when all of its parts are cemented together as one, every side being of itself and not easily scattered. We sometimes see this in stones and diverse bodies with a certain natural power that are thus cemented and united, and inside they are seen as one, such as with two trees that are grafted, and oysters with the strength of stones by a certain occult nature. We have seen animals turned into stones, and thus they are united with the substance of stones, now as one body, and can be seen as effectively homogenous; thus, ebony is in a manner a kind of wood and a kind of stone.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, when any mixture is made from many materials under celestial influences, then indeed there is a variety of celestial actions. Hence the true natural power is gathered and causes certain miracles through unguents, collyries, fumigations, and the like, and such kinds were clearly gathered in the book
    #emph[Kyranides];#t_footnote(630)[5] Archytas, Democritus, and Hermes, who wrote the [the book of]

  #p_normal[
    Such is the great power of prepared matter, which we then see gain life when a perfect mixture of qualities seems to break the previous contrariety. However, the more perfect takes life, but by as much as their complexion is removed from contrariety. Indeed, the heavens are a very powerful cause from which each thing is initiated into generation, by the concoction and perfect coming together of matter.#t_footnote(634)[4] It grants celestial influences and wonderful gifts with life,#t_footnote(635)[5] as much as is contained in life itself and in the sensible soul, [these qualities being present] according to more noble virtues and sublime conceptions.

    Additionally, celestial virtue often lies asleep elsewhere. For example, sulfur is far from f lame, but in living bodies it is often inflamed as kindled sulfur. Then its vapor fills all that is near it.#t_footnote(636)[6] Thus, certain wonderful works are produced, as is compiled in the book

Scorpions [are generated] from a crab, if its feet are removed and buried. Frogs are generated from a dried duck when ground into powder and thrown into water, but if baked into a cake, cut into pieces, and left in a damp and underground place, it will generate toads. Scorpions are generated from the herb basil if rubbed between two stones. If the hair of a menstruating woman is placed under dung, it will produce serpents. If the hair from the tail of a horse is thrown into water, it will conceive life and will turn into dangerous worms. There is an art in which an egg generates a form similar to a man, of which I have seen and learned to compose, and magicians say holds wonderful virtues,#t_footnote(640)[10] and they also say this is true of the mandrake.

    Therefore, you must recognize which and what kinds of materials, either by nature or art, begun or completed, or collected from many [things], which celestial influences they are able to receive.#t_footnote(641)[11] Indeed, the agreement of natural things is sufficient for drawing from celestial influences: because nothing hinders the celestials from pouring down their light toward the inferiors, and they permit no matter from being void of their virtues.#t_footnote(642)[12]

    As the Platonists say, and Hermes Trismegistus, Iarchus Brachmanus, and all the Hebrew mekubalim#t_footnote(644)[1] agree, what is under the orb of the Moon in the inferior world is subject to generation and corruption. This is also the same in the celestial world, but in a certain celestial way, and also in the intellectual world, but in a much more perfect and good way, and finally the most perfect in the archetypal world. And with this sequence, each inferior has its superior and responds to the most superior of its kind and receives from it. Indeed, the heavens receive those virtues from the divine, which is called the quintessence, or the World Soul, or the middle nature. However, from the intellectual world [it receives] a spiritual and living vigor, transcending all qualitative virtues. Finally, from the archetypal world through these intermediaries, [it receives] of the whole perfection according to the degree of their original power.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Hence, each thing can be appropriately reduced from these lowest inferiors to the stars, from the stars to the intelligences, and then from the archetypal world to each one. From this sequence arises all magic and occult philosophy.#t_footnote(645)[2] Indeed, something natural is drawn daily by skill, and daily something divine is drawn by nature. The Egyptians saw this and called nature magic—that is, the power of magic is an attraction of like with like and agreement with agreement.#t_footnote(646)[3] But the Greeks called this kind of attraction through the mutual agreement of things with each other of superiors with inferiors συμπάθειαν.#t_footnote(647)[4] Thus, earth agrees with cold water, water with moist air, air with hot fire, and fire agrees with matter#t_footnote(648)[5] in heaven.#t_footnote(649)[6] Fire cannot be mixed with water unless through air, nor can air be mixed with earth unless through water. Thus, the soul cannot be mixed with the body unless through spirit, and the intellect cannot be mixed with spirit unless through soul.

    Thus, we see nature producing the form of the human body. With this preparation, it immediately entices the spirit from the universe, as dried wood is prepared to receive oil; this oil is the food for fire, and fire itself is the vehicle for light. Thus, spirit is the kindling wood for connecting the soul with the body, and subsequently, the soul is the kindling wood in the spirit and body for the intelligence and mind of God.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    From these examples, we see how certain reliable natural and artificial preparations can accept certain celestial gifts from above.#t_footnote(650)[7] Indeed, stones and metals agree with herbs, herbs with animals, and truly [animals] with the heavens, [the heavens] with the intelligences, and [the intelligences] with divine qualities and attributes together with God, to whom all likenesses and images are created. But the first likeness of God is the universe, man of the universe, animal of man, zoophytum of animals, [zoophytum] with plants, but plants of metals, and of [metals] stones represent similar images.#t_footnote(651)[8] Again in spirituality, plants agree with beasts in vegetation, beasts with man in senses, man with daemons in intellect, and [daemons] with God in immortality.#t_footnote(652)[9]
    Divinity is connected with mind, mind with intellect, intellect with intention, intention with imagination, imagination with senses, and finally the senses with things.#t_footnote(653)[10]

    Thus, inferior and superior are connected with each other, as the influence from their head the First Cause, as it were with a certain tensed string, stretched as far as the lowest.

    Magicians teach that by inferiors conforming to superiors, [inferiors] can draw appropriate celestial influences from the heavens. Thus, likewise through these, celestials and celestial daemons, as they are the attendants of the stars, can be acquired and insinuate [themselves into] us. Whereby certain reliable materials have a natural power of divinity and a natural harmony with the superiors, rightly collected, partially with natural science, partially with astronomy, are suitably aroused on all sides. The gifts are not only celestial or vital but certain intellectual, daemonic, and divine gifts are received from above as well. This is confirmed by Iamblichus, Proclus, Synesius, and the whole Platonic school.#t_footnote(655)[1] Hermes Trismegistus wrote of certain special things about a particular appropriate daemon—that is, where an appropriate image is composed and animated by the appropriate daemon.#t_footnote(656)[2] Augustine also remembers this in the eighth book of

This is because one operative virtue is diffused through all kinds of participating things.#t_footnote(658)[4] Indeed, this virtue is produced by occult reasons. Thus, the magician takes these manifestations so that he attracts occult things; for example, [one may attract] the rays of the stars through fumigations, lights, sounds, and natural things that agree with the celestials. Besides their corporeal qualities, [these things] also belong to incorporeal and divine reason: senses, number, and measurements.

    Thus, we read that the ancients often accepted something divine and wonderful through certain natural things.#t_footnote(659)[5] For example, a stone that is produced in the pupil of a hyena’s eye, if held under the tongue, excels in allowing one to speak predictions.#t_footnote(660)[6] The same effect is said of selenites, a Lunar stone.#t_footnote(661)[7] Also, the stone
    #emph[anchitide]#t_footnote(662)[8] is said to summon images of the gods, and the #emph[synochitide] when held summons inferior shades.#t_footnote(663)[9] Similarly, the herb
    #emph[aglaopotis,] which is also called #emph[marmoritides] and grows on the side of marble in Arabia and Persia, is also effective, as Pliny said, and “magicians use this when they wish to summon the gods.”#t_footnote(664)[10] As well, magicians can prophesy with the herb called
    #emph[theangelidam] when it is drunk.#t_footnote(665)[11] Besides these, there are also herbs with which the dead can come back to life. The historian Xanthus wrote that with a certain herb called #emph[bali] a young dragon that was killed was brought back to life, and a certain man [named] Tillon who was killed by a dragon was brought back to life.#t_footnote(666)[12] Juba reported that in Arabia a man was brought back to life with a certain herb.

    However, whether such things are possible to men from the power of herbs or any other natural thing will be discussed later, but if they are possible in other animals, it is certain and known. Thus, if a drowned fly is placed in warm ash, it will come back to life,#t_footnote(667)[13] and drowned bees will likewise revive in the juice of catnip.#t_footnote(668)[14] Eels that are dead from not enough water, if their entire bodies are placed under dung, and vinegar and the blood of a vulture is added, will revive after a few days.#t_footnote(669)[15] It is said that if an echeneis is cut into small pieces and thrown into the sea, after a while the parts will come together and come to life again. Likewise, we know that a pelican, when killed, can restore its chicks to life with its own blood.#t_footnote(670)[16]

    No one ignores that evil daemons can be drawn with evil and profane arts, as Psellus said. Gnostic magicians customarily performed powerful curses and abominable disgraces#t_footnote(671)[1] in the past, such as sacrifices to Priapus, and served idols named Panor, to whom they sacrificed with their genitals uncovered. This is not unlike (if this is true and not a fable) what we read about the Templars’ detestable heresy,#t_footnote(672)[2] and there are similar heresies of female witches, where indeed demented old women are often shamefully apprehended in error.

    Therefore from these and the like, evil daemons are drawn and conspire, just as the malignant daemon said to John about the magician Cynops: “All the power of Satan inhabits that place, and he enters into a conspiracy with all principalities and we with him; Cynops obeys us and we obey him.”#t_footnote(673)[3] Again, no one ignores the opposite that super-celestial angels can be received by us through good operations with a pure mind, mysterious orations, devoted supplications, and the like.

    Thus we read that ancient priests made statues and images that predicted the future and infused them with the spirits of the stars.

In advance, she prepared the customary instruments for her deadly workshop: all kinds of spices, plates with unknown letters engraved on them, and the petrified remains of unfortunate birds on nails, the various lamented and buried members of corpses scattered: noses and fingers, nails with flesh hanging on them, elsewhere a store of blood from slaughtered men and skulls mutilated by the teeth of wild beasts. Then she chanted over the quivering entrails making offerings of various liquids, now spring water, now cow’s milk, now with mountain honey and honey-wine. Then she took the borrowed hairs and tied them together and then into knots and threw it onto burning charcoals with many scents. Then with the invincible power of her magic and the blind force of her gods, the hairs violently crackled and smoked, and changed into the spirit of a man that sensed, heard, and walked, led by the odor of the hair, coming on behalf of the young Boeotian eagerly bounding to the door.#t_footnote(685)[7]

    #emph[The power of menstrual blood.]

  #p_normal[
    For example, menstrual blood has a great power in sorceries. For, as they say, if the blood is added to fresh new wine, [the wine] will turn sour; if [the blood] touches the vine, [the vine] will be damaged forever; if it touches crops, [the crops] will become barren, killing them. It also destroys plants in the garden and causes fruit on trees to fall. [It causes the] reflections in a mirror to darken. It blunts the sharpness of iron barber’s knives, dulls the beauty of ivory, and causes iron to immediately rust. Also, when it touches copper, it causes a terrible odor and makes it rust. Dogs are driven into madness when tasting it, and if one is bitten by such a dog, the wound is incurable. If it touches beehives, it will kill the bees and will make them flee.#t_footnote(687)[1] If boiled with linen, [the linen] will turn black. Mares will miscarry if they touch it while pregnant. It will also cause a miscarriage in pregnant women if they are smeared with it. Asses will not conceive for many years as long as they eat grain contaminated with the blood. Ashes of menstrual cloths, if sprinkled over clothes being washed, will change their purple color, and it will remove the color from flowers.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Tertian and quartan fevers are driven away if menstrual blood is enclosed in a silver bracelet with black ram’s wool. It is also said to be effective against tertian and quartan fevers if placed under the feet of the sick person, and it is more effective if done by the woman [herself] and the [patient] is ignorant of it. It also cures attacks of epilepsy. But all agree that if one is bitten by a dog and dreads water or drinking,#t_footnote(688)[2] if a cloth dripped in menstrual blood is placed under their cup, the fear immediately disappears. It is also said that if a menstruating woman walks nude through a field, grubs, worms, beetles, blister-beetles, and all harmful things fall; but beware that this does not happen with the rising Sun, or the crops will wither. Similarly, it expels hail and whirlwinds and is against lightning. Pliny himself wrote about many of these.

    You must know that the poison is greater if the Moon is waning, and even stronger when the Moon is silent;#t_footnote(689)[3] but if it happens while in an eclipse of the Moon or Sun, [the poison] is beyond cure. It is truly the most powerful and vigorous during the purity of the first years and during virginity, for if it touches all the posts of the house, all maleficence will be ineffective therein.

  #p_normal[
    It is also said that the threads of garments that have touched [menstrual blood] will not be burned by fire, and if thrown into a fire, [the fire] will not increase.#t_footnote(690)[4] It is likewise said that if peony root with castor is smeared on a menstruous cloth and given to a patient, epilepsy will be cured. If the stomach of a stag is burned or roasted and fumigated with a menstruous cloth, crossbows will be useless for hunting. The hair of a menstruating woman placed under dung will beget serpents,#t_footnote(691)[5] and if the hair is burned, serpents will flee from the scent;#t_footnote(692)[6] for this poison is so powerful that it is poisonous to venomous creatures.

    #emph[Hippomanes.]

  #p_normal[
    There is the piece of tissue called hippomanes,#t_footnote(693)[7] which among sorceries is no less famous [than menstrual blood]. It is the size of a fig, black in color, and appears on the forehead of a newborn foal. Unless the mare immediately swallows [the hippomanes], her soul will turn away from her child and she will never feed it.#t_footnote(694)[8] Because of this, it is said it has a great power for stirring up love when it is pulverized, mixed with the blood of the lover, and drunk [by the beloved].

  #p_normal[
    There is another sorcery called by the same name of hippomanes, which is a venom flowing from the groin of mares when she is in passionate love;#t_footnote(695)[9] as remembered by Virgil:

The roots are underground and its freshly cut flesh and juice coming from it is black as if it were beech.”#t_footnote(698)[12] [This herb], if they were able, before completing their devotions to Proserpina, should be smeared on the body, so that they will not be harmed by either weapon or fire.

    Hyenas also inflict many sorceries: for instance, as referred by Pliny, its blood applied to doorposts, damages the skills of magic, so that one will neither be able to elicit or talk to the gods, in any way.#t_footnote(701)[15] Likewise, the ashes of [a hyena’s] left ankle boiled with the blood of a weasel and smeared all over causes hatred. This also happens with a boiled eye. Additionally, the tube of the outer intestine counteracts powerful iniquities from leaders and administrators, for successful petitions, and for influencing the judgments of lawsuits, if anyone has a small amount [of the intestines] with them. Likewise, if [the intestine] is bound to the left arm, it will prompt love when they see a woman, and she will follow him.#t_footnote(702)[16] The skin of the forehead resists bewitchings.#t_footnote(703)[17]

    Likewise, they say that if a tick is pulled from a dog’s left ear, and that tick only be the color black, it augurs great strength in life. For instance, if a person brings such a tick to a sick person, stands at their feet, asks about his illness, and the sick person responds, it is a certain hope for life.#t_footnote(705)[19]

  #p_normal[
    It is likewise said that a stone bitten by a rabid dog has the power of discord if it is placed in a drink.#t_footnote(706)[20] One will not be barked at by dogs if a dog’s tongue is placed in the shoe or under the big toe,#t_footnote(707)[21] especially if joined with the herb of the same name—that is, hound’s tongue.#t_footnote(708)[22] The same happens with the membrane of a dog’s afterbirth,#t_footnote(709)[23] but dogs flee from those carrying a dog’s heart.#t_footnote(710)[24]

    Pliny wrote about frogs called #emph[rubetarum,]#t_footnote(711)[25] which are only found in thorn bushes, are full of sorceries, and make wonderful things happen. For instance, the small bone that is on its left side will immediately boil cold water if thrown into it. It will restrain attacking dogs and stir up love and quarrels if added to potions. If bound to someone, it will incite lust. The opposite bone, because it is on the right side, will cool boiling water, and [the water] will not boil afterward unless removed. It will cure quartan fevers if bound in fresh lamb’s#t_footnote(712)[26] skin, and it inhibits other fevers, love, and lust. However, the spleen and heart from this frog helps against sorceries which come from it.#t_footnote(713)[27] Pliny wrote this.

    It is said that [a piece of] iron that has killed a man has wonderful powers among sorceries. For instance, if a horse’s bridle or spurs are made from it, they say that all horses—even the wildest—may be easily ruled and tamed. If added to the horse’s feet, it will make them very swift and [the horse] will not tire easily from the effort [of running]. Additionally, certain characters and names can be inscribed.

    It is also said that “if one dips a sword that beheaded a man into wine, any sick person who drinks this will be cured of quartan fever.” It is also said that a drink made from a bear’s brain and drunk from its skull will cause the madness of a bear.#t_footnote(714)[28] Thus, a man drinking this will believe himself transformed into a bear and think that all things he sees to be a bear; thus, the madness will continue until which time the power of the drink relaxes and no other evil is perceived in their complexion.

  #p_normal[
    Certain fumigations are also suitable for many of the stars, inasmuch as air and spirit#t_footnote(715)[1] can exceedingly affect [things] by grasping appropriate celestial gifts under the rays of the stars. Indeed, our spirits are very much changed by these vapors because each is a vapor similar to the other. Also, air through these vapors is easily affected by inferior and celestial qualities, continuously and suddenly entering our breasts, bringing us wonderful qualities.#t_footnote(716)[2] This is why fumigations are used to summon mental images for prophecies, which are suitable for certain divinities for conforming us to accept divine inspiration.#t_footnote(717)[3] Thus it is said that fumigations made from flax and psyllium#t_footnote(718)[4] seeds, violet roots, and parsley cause visions of future things and bring prophecy.#t_footnote(719)[5]
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Fumigations conducive for prophecy.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    No one can truly wonder how great fumigations are in air. Porphyry believed that certain reliable vapors exhaling from special fumigations immediately draw and introduce airy daemons,#t_footnote(720)[6] inducing thunder and lightning, and the like. For example, burning a chameleon’s liver on the top of a roof arouses rain and thunder; similarly, [a chameleon’s] head and throat, if burned with oak wood, also makes violent rain and thunder.#t_footnote(721)[7]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Also, fumigations under appropriate stellar influences make the images of daemons immediately appear in the air or elsewhere. They say that if a fumigation is made with coriander and parsley, or henbane with hemlock juice, daemons immediately gather—hence those herbs are called spiritual. It is likewise said that a fumigation mixture made from the root of
    #emph[ferulae]#t_footnote(722)[8] with hemlock juice, henbane, #emph[tassi barbassi,]#t_footnote(723)[9] red sandalwood, and black poppyseed causes daemons and unusual figures to appear. If parsley#t_footnote(724)[10] is added to this, daemons will flee from all places and destroy the images. In a similar way a fumigation made from calamint, peony, mint, and the castor oil plant#t_footnote(725)[11] drives away all evil spirits and harmful phantoms.#t_footnote(726)[12]
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Spiritual herbs.]

  #p_normal[
    Additionally, it is said that certain fumigations cause some animals to gather near or to chase [the animals] away, such as the fumigation of
    #emph[liparis]#t_footnote(727)[13] mentioned by Pliny summons all beasts.#t_footnote(728)[14] Thus, the bones at the top of the throat of a stag gather serpents, but a fumigation of a deer’s antler chases them away.#t_footnote(729)[15] The same [effect] happens [with serpents] with a fumigation of peacock feathers.#t_footnote(730)[16] Similarly, burning an ass’s lung chases away all venomous things. A fumigation of a horse’s hoof chases away mice from the house. The same happens with the hooves of a she-mule, and flies are likewise chased away if the left hoof is [burned].#t_footnote(731)[17] It is said that if a house is fumigated from any place with the gall of a cuttlefish mixed with
    #emph[thymiamate,]#t_footnote(732)[18] roses, and lignum aloe, and then if seawater or blood is left in that place, the entire house will be seen as full of [water] or blood. If [the fumigation mixture] is left there with plowed earth, the earth will be seen as quaking.#t_footnote(733)[19]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But vapors of this kind will affect any body (although these virtues influence and persist daily) as can be observed, [in the same way as] any contagion or poisonous pestilent vapor. If they are kept in the walls of a house beyond two years, [the vapors] inflict the inhabitants, and with epidemics or leprosy hidden in clothes when worn daily, will infect the wearer.#t_footnote(734)[20]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Images and rings and the like are magical instruments, and certain fumigations summon hidden treasures, of which no less than Porphyry testified.#t_footnote(735)[21] Thus it is said: “If one can bury gold, silver, or any other valuable with the Sun and Moon conjunct the
    #emph[Imum coeli,]#t_footnote(736)[22] then fumigate that place with coriander, saffron, henbane, parsley, and black poppyseed in equal weights, bruised and steeped in hemlock juice. At no time will this be discovered or stolen, because thus hidden, it is always guarded by daemons. If anyone attempts to steal from there, they will be vexed and fall into madness.”#t_footnote(737)[23]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Hermes said that there is nothing equal to a fumigation of spermaceti#t_footnote(738)[24] for drawing daemons: if [it is] steeped with lignum aloe, costus, musk, saffron, and
    #emph[thymiamate,] with the blood of a hoopoe, and made into a fumigation, it gathers airy spirits very quickly. If it is fumigated around the graves of the dead, it gathers shades of the underworld and shades of the dead.#t_footnote(739)[25]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Thus, often when we direct operations for the Sun, we use Solar fumigations; for the Moon, Lunar fumigations, and similarly for the rest. And you must know that, as there are oppositions and enmity in the stars and spirits, it is also the case in the fumigations for them. For example, lignum aloe and sulfur are contrary to each other, as are frankincense and quicksilver; and spirits induced by burning lignum aloe and sulfur will flee.#t_footnote(740)[26] Proclus gives an example of a spirit who usually appeared in the form of a lion, but by throwing a rooster before it, it soon disappeared, because roosters are contrary to lions.#t_footnote(741)[27] Thus, consider and practice this in a like fashion.

Of Venus are flowers, rose, violet, saffron, and the like. Mercury has all bark from wood and fruit, such as cinnamon, cassia wood, mace, citrus peel, laurel grain,#t_footnote(745)[4] and all fragrant seeds.

    You must also know that (according to the opinions of magicians) you must use fumigations that are good, fragrant and costly in all good operations—such as for love, favor, and the like. But in malefic operations, such as for hatred, anger, disaster, and the like, you must use fumigations that are foul smelling and cheap.

  ]
  #p_normal[
    Collyries#t_footnote(751)[1] and ointments harmonize natural and celestial powers around our spirits. They multiply, change, transform, and change in shape. They also transpose those forces that belong to themselves: not only can they act in their own body but also near them#t_footnote(752)[2] and by visible rays, through bewitchings, and touch by a certain similar quality.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But our spirits are a vapor of blood: subtle, pure, lucid, airy, and unctuous.#t_footnote(753)[3] We, therefore, make collyries uniting similar vapors, which are more agreeable to our spirits in substance. Then, because of their great similarity, [these collyries] draw, attract, and change the spirit.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Some ointments and other confections hold similar virtues. Such substances work through contact. Whether anointed by the hands or garments, these may induce sickness, poison, or love. Similarly, through kisses, certain things held in the mouth induce love, as we read in Virgil of Venus’s entreat to Cupid:

  #p_normal[
    But sight, because it is the purest of the senses, perceives the clearest and sharpest, and fastens us to the highest things, is greater and more appropriate than the other senses for spiritual imagination. This is because [spiritual insights] appear in dreams, which we see offered more often than by sound, or the other senses.#t_footnote(755)[5]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, when collyries transform visual spirits, those spirits easily affect the imagination. These indeed affect different appearances and forms, transmitting these by the same spirit to the external sense of sight, which in that way cause by chance the sensation of appearances and forms, as if moved by exterior objects. One sees terrible images in this way, daemons and the like.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, collyries are made so that we can immediately see shadowy daemons of the air or elsewhere, of which I have learned to make from a preparation of the gall of a man, the eyes of a black cat, and certain other things.#t_footnote(756)[6] Also like this, is a preparation from the blood of a hoopoe, bat, and a male goat. As it is said: “If you take a steel mirror with the juice of mugwort#t_footnote(757)[7] and fumigate, it makes it possible to see hidden spirits.”
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Thus, certain fumigations or ointments are made to make one speak in their sleep, walk and perform the work of those who are awake, or some [works] that [waking people] will scarcely dare to do. Some make us hear horrible or pleasing sounds, the sources of which are not present.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    It is because of this that some deranged and melancholic [people] believe themselves to see or hear other things that are nowhere else than inside the fantasy of their imagination. Hence, they fear things that should not be feared, fall into strange and false suspicions, flee attackers that are not there, get angry and fight people who are not there, and fear where there is nothing to fear.

    Of these kinds of passions, there are also magical confections induced that happen through fumigations, collyries, ointments, potions, poisons, lamps and lights, mirrors, images, incantations and songs, sounds and harmonies made from certain animal sinews, and also through various rites, observations, ceremonies, religions and superstitions, which will be discussed in their places.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Not only by these arts are these kinds of passions, apparitions, and imaginations induced, but, in fact, also things and men can be exchanged and transformed into various forms, such as the poet wrote about Proteus, Pericleminus, Achelous, and Metra the daughter of Erisichthon.#t_footnote(758)[8] “Circe changed the companions of Ulysses,”#t_footnote(759)[9] and as once [happened] with the sacred Lycaean Jupiter, who ate the entrails of a sacrifice, changed a man to a wolf. Pliny said this happened to a certain Demarchus.#t_footnote(760)[10]

  #p_normal[
    Augustine thought the same. He said that while in Italy, certain women gave travelers sorceries in cheese that changed them into mules and then back again. When the load [the women] wished to be carried was finished, [the mules] were restored to men. The father of a certain Praestantius also befell this accident.#t_footnote(761)[11] The sacred scriptures themselves testify that Pharaoh’s magicians changed their wands into serpents and water into blood, among other things.#t_footnote(762)[12]

    The World Soul, since by its virtues all things naturally generated or artificial are made fertile, infuses its celestial qualities for operating wonderful effects. [It affects] things not only through fumigations, collyries, ointments, potions, or anything else in this manner, but also when appropriately wrapped by alligations, suspended by the neck, or placed anywhere else or by the lightest contact. By such methods, it imprints its virtues onto us.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, through these alligations, suspensions,#t_footnote(763)[1] wrappings, substitutions, and contact with the body, the soul is accidentally#t_footnote(764)[2] changed through illness, health, boldness, fear, sadness, gladness, and the like.#t_footnote(765)[3] [The World Soul] returns to the wearer kindness or fright, acceptance or rejection, honor and esteem, or distaste and abomination.#t_footnote(766)[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But these kinds of passions are said to be infused by no other [reason] than as is shown in the grafting of trees,#t_footnote(767)[5] where the vital virtues are transferred from the trunk to the branch grafted onto it, bound to the other, as if by contact but not touching each other.#t_footnote(768)[6] For example, when a female palm tree approaches the male, her branches bend toward him and curve. When gardeners see this, they bind the branches from male to female, then return to their straight positions, as she has now inherited the male’s virtues through the continuity of the rope.#t_footnote(769)[7]

    In a similar way, we see that the torpedo fish strikes the hand of those who touch it, even from a distance with a long rod.#t_footnote(770)[8] Also, if one touches a sea hare#t_footnote(771)[9] with a hand or stick while ill, their mind will become defective. It is also said that if a starfish with the blood of a fox is fastened to a door with a copper nail, one will not be able to be harmed by evil medicines.#t_footnote(772)[10] It is also said that if a woman takes a needle and stains it with dung, then wraps it in dirt where a human corpse is buried and carries it with her in a cloth that was used in the funeral, no man will have intercourse with her while she has it with her.#t_footnote(773)[11]

  #p_normal[
    Now, from these examples we see how some virtues can be received by certain things, alligations, suspensions, simple contacts, or by some continuation of a thread.

  #p_quote[
    #emph[Alligations and wrappings and how they should be made.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    We should learn the laws of these alligations and suspensions, and the suitable manner of their art, such as being made under a certain constellation. It is said that alligations and suspensions can be harmoniously made with metallic thread, silk, hair, sinew, fur, or bristles from certain animals. However, wrappings can be made from the leaves of herbs, animal skin, or certain cloths, and the like, as long as they are things that agree with each other—such as if you wish to acquire the virtue of some Solar thing, wrap these in laurel leaves or lion skin, and you can suspend this from the neck by a golden or a yellow silk thread while the Sun is in its ruling sign in the sky.#t_footnote(774)[12] Thus, you will indeed share the Solar virtues of that thing. If you wish the virtue of some Saturnian thing (especially if it is devoted to sadness), then in a similar way wrap the alligation in an ass’s pelt or funerary garment and hang it by a black thread while Saturn is dominating. In a similar way consider the rest.

    Additionally, rings, which the ancients always esteemed, send out their virtues to us when appropriately made. They do this in a way similar to alligations and suspensions. By wearing them, they affect the spirit of the [wearer] with happiness or sadness, mildness or frightfulness, boldness or timidity, friendliness or hate. As such, they also fortify us against illnesses, poisons, enemies, cacodaemons,#t_footnote(775)[1] and against any other evil, or can bind us to the evils.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Moreover, the manner of constructing these kinds of rings is this: clearly, when some fortunate star is rising and the Moon is in a good aspect or conjunct it, we must take a stone or herb subordinate to the star and the ring made from a metal similar to the star. Fasten the stone in the ring, placing the herb or root under it.#t_footnote(776)[2] Finally, do not forget to inscribe the images, name, characters under that star and [the star’s] fumigations (we will discuss this elsewhere, in the treatises on images and characters).

    Thus, we read in Philostratus that Iarchus, the wise Indian prince, commissioned seven rings to be made with the virtues of the seven planets and their names marked on them.

By this favor, [Apollonius] lived for more than 130 years and always retained the brightness of youth.#t_footnote(777)[3]

    In a similar way Moses, Hebrew lawgiver and prince, instructed in the magic of Egypt, prepared rings for love and oblivion, according to Josephus.#t_footnote(778)[4] It was also said by Aristotle, that among the Cyrenes#t_footnote(779)[5] there was a ring of Battus that was for gratitude and honor. We additionally read in Eudamus, a certain philosopher, of a ring that was prepared against serpent bites, bewitchings, and daemons.#t_footnote(780)[6] Josephus said the same about Solomon.#t_footnote(781)[7] We also read in Plato about Gyges, the Lydian king who had a ring with wondrous and unusual virtues. When Gyges held that ring’s sigil in his palm, [he] would change so that no one could see him, but he could see everything. By relying on the opportunity of that ring, Gyges killed the [man who was then] king, shamed the queen, and killed whoever opposed him. No one was able to see him while he did these deeds. From the benefit of this ring, he became king of Lydia.#t_footnote(782)[8]

    There are wondrous virtues for places, whether from things in those places, from stellar influences accompanying them, or from any distant method.

    Thus, it is said that if bees are sprinkled with the dust collected from the track of a serpent, they will return to their beehive. Likewise, the dust in the place where a she-mule has rolled, if sprinkled on the body, will soften the fires of love.#t_footnote(784)[2] Moreover, if the dust in which a hawk has rolled itself is bound with red linen, it cures quartan fever.#t_footnote(785)[3] Also, a small stone collected from a swallow’s nest is said to immediately cure epilepsy, and if bound will perpetually protect from it, especially if a swallow’s blood or heart is wrapped with it.#t_footnote(786)[4] It is said that if one has a cut vein, and while they are fasting, walks over to a place where someone recently fell into an epileptic state, they will catch that sickness. Pliny wrote that an iron nail fastened in the place where the head first fell into an epileptic state will cure him of that evil.#t_footnote(787)[5] Also if the herbs growing in the head of a statue are collected and bound in any garments with a red thread, pain in the head will immediately weaken. Furthermore, whatever herbs are collected from streams or fountains before sunrise and bound to the left arm will cure tertian fever—that is, if no one sees them collecting the herbs and if the sick person is unaware of it.#t_footnote(788)[6]

    With this reasoning, for operations for love one customarily takes the instruments of their art—rings, images, mirrors, or other things—and buries or hides them in a brothel#t_footnote(791)[9] during some specific time, as that place will cause in them certain Venusian abilities. It is not thought otherwise: things standing in foul-smelling places bring about foul smells, and things in aromatic places make aromatic and pleasing scents.

    This also concerns the positions of the world itself. Hence, if collecting Saturnian, Martial, or Jupiterian herbs, look to the east or the south—the first because they are happy when oriental from the Sun,#t_footnote(792)[10] the other because it is their chief domicile—that is, Aquarius, Scorpio, and Sagittarius are signs that are southern. It is the same with Capricorn and Pisces. However, collecting things that are Venereal, Mercurial, or Lunar look toward the west, because they are happy in the west, or to the north, because their chief domiciles are Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, and Virgo, signs that are northern. Thus, in Solar operations, you must look against the east or south, but rather always toward the body of the Sun itself and the light.

Then [it diffuses] into the Son, a glorious magnificence and exuberance; in the Holy Spirit, a burning brightness surpassing all of the intelligences; and then, as Dionysius said, the Seraphim.#t_footnote(794)[2] In angels are diffused a shining intelligence and lavish joy to all bounds of reason, yet received in separate degrees, according to the nature of the intelligence accepting it. [Light] successively descends through the celestials, where it makes an abundance of life and the capability of propagation, and also a visible splendor. In fire is a certain natural vigor engrafted from the celestials. Finally, in men is the clear course of reason, understanding of divine things, and all reason: but this has many layers, either from the disposition of the body, as believed by the Peripatetics, or more truly, on behalf of the pleasure of a bountiful cause, “who divides each according to its wishes.”#t_footnote(795)[3] It passes then to the imagination, yet above the senses, but only the imaginable, and then finally to the senses, especially to the eyes.

    In [the eyes] happens a visible clarity, extending out to evident bodies in which color and beauty happen—but in the dark, certain benefic and generative virtues penetrate as far as the center, where color is fogged, tormented, and boiled up.

    Therefore, magicians forbid sprinkling the shadow of a sick person with urine, and also prohibit a sick person to be naked against the Sun or Moon,#t_footnote(798)[6] because the rays of light suddenly penetrate the diseased body.

    There are also artificial lights from certain lamps, lanterns, candles, and the like. [These are generated] from choosing certain reliable things and fluids, and from the stars’ patterns, and a harmonious composition of them. When they are kindled and shine alone, they often produce wonderful and celestial effects which men admire. Pliny wrote of this from Anaxilaus: that the poison of mares after copulation kindled in lamps shows monstrous visions of the heads of horses. It is similar with asses.#t_footnote(800)[8] Furthermore, flies roughly mixed with wax and lit causes visions of flies.

Blue toward whiteness shows phlegm, for cold whitens, and moisture and dryness darkens. Reddish color shows blood, but fire or flaming shows choler, which because of its subtlety, easily mixes with everything and causes various colors: for if it is mixed with blood, it will dominate and be strongly red. If choler dominates, it will become somewhat red. If equally mixed, it will make a weak red. But if blood is mixed with choler, it makes a scorched hemp color, or red with blood dominating, or somewhat red with choler dominating. But if mixed with a melancholic humor, it makes black. But if melancholy and phlegm are equally mixed, it makes a hemp color. If phlegm is very abundant, [it makes] a muddy color.

    Bewitchings are a binding, in which the spirit of the enchanter enters the eyes of the bewitched until it reaches the heart. However, the instrument of bewitchings is spirit—that is, a certain pure vapor, which is clear, subtle, and generated from the pure blood and heat of the heart. Enchanters always emit sympathetic rays through the eyes. These rays send out a spiritual vapor with them. That vapor is a blood, as is evident by the inflamed and red eyes of such people. These rays emit a vapor of corrupt blood when they are exposed to the eyes observing them, and, this infects the observing eyes with sickness and similar afflictions.

Thus, strongly bound, the sharp rays of the eyes or a certain sudden gaze#t_footnote(815)[5] kindle strong loves, as if penetrating the entire body by spear or a blow. Then, with the spirit and amorous blood injured, [the passions aroused by this gaze] are carried by the lover and bewitcher and no other.

For instance, they induce love by using Venusian collyries from hippomanes, pigeon, or sparrow blood, and the like; for inducing fear, they make use of Martial collyries from the eyes of a wolf, hyena, and the like; for disaster or sickness they use Saturnine [collyries].

    Likewise, it is said that certain acts and observations possess the power of certain natural things. For instance, it is believed that certain illnesses can be removed by introducing some of these: quartan fever is said to be alleviated if the clipped nails of a sick person are bound around the neck with a living eel in a bandage, after doing which the eel is to be released in the water. Pliny said that if the clipped nails from feet and hands of a sick person are mixed with wax, this is supposed to cure quartan, tertian, or ordinary fever. If fastened to another person’s door before the rising Sun, [this mixture of nails and wax] will cure [that person’s] illness. In a similar way, when nail clippings are left near ant holes, take the first ant that begins to draw one and bind it to the neck [of the sick person].

    Auspices must first be taken at the beginning of each operation. For example, if at the beginning of a labor you see that a mouse has chewed your garment, abandon the work. If going out you stumble on the threshold, or on the way strike your foot, hold your journey.

    We see that many animals by certain powers engrafted by nature are prestigious and prophetic.

    It would take too long to unravel all of the prognostications from birds and animals known by the Phrygians, Cilicians, Arabians, Umbrians, Etruscans and other people who followed those auguries,#t_footnote(863)[1] which were proved through many experiments and examples. In all things, the oracles of the future are as much as hidden. But the greatest
    of these are birds that announce omens: these are those that poets say were men
    turned into birds. Therefore, a crow will speak, carefully overhearing and
    stationed in their setting or flying from the right or left, speaking or

    As Horapollo said in #emph[Hieroglyphics:] “Twin crows signify marriages,

    However, if (and this is rare) two males or two females are born, the males will
    not couple with females or mix with other crows. Likewise, females with other
    males, but will only continue estranged. Therefore, if meeting a single crow,
    this augurs for the future that one will live their life as a widow.#t_footnote(864)[2]

    Swans, who foretell secrets of the waters, are considered because of their cheerfulness to not only foretell happy outcomes for sailors but also for other travelers. [This is true] unless the swans are overcome by a stronger attack—such as from eagles, whose powerful authority rules over all other birds. If the eagle speaks against them, he weakens them, since he flies higher and can see farther than other birds and is never excluded from the secrets of Jupiter. Eagles portend height and victory, but through blood, because they drink not water, but blood.#t_footnote(867)[5]

Owls are always unlucky as is the little owl, which, because they approach chickens unforeseen at night, just as death approaches unforeseen, it is therefore said that they foretell death.#t_footnote(883)[21] Yet sometimes, because they are not blind in the darkness of night, owls are said to signify diligence and vigilance in men—because [an owl] was approved when it settled on the spear of Hiero.#t_footnote(884)[22] However, Dido saw unluckiness in owls when stirring up Aeneas; of which the poet sang:

    Also, small birds arriving or departing portends the increase or decrease of one’s family.

Fulvius was torn apart by a wolf when the Roman army was overcome by the slaves in Sicily.#t_footnote(909)[47] [The wolf] also signifies faithless men and bad faith. This was known to the descendants of Romulus, who [with Remus] had formerly sucked faith from the shewolf and kept it to themselves from the beginning, and it flowed as if by natural law to their descendants.#t_footnote(910)[48]

    If a lion is met, it is good, since among other animals it is the strongest and strikes fear in all.#t_footnote(911)[49] However, a woman meeting a lioness is bad because it impedes conception: this is because a lioness does not give birth a second time.#t_footnote(912)[50] Meeting sheep and goats is good: as was gathered in the #emph[Prodigies of the Etruscans,]#t_footnote(913)[51] if this animal has any unusual color, it portends to the emperor the abundance of all things with happiness.

    It is also good to meet an ox threshing, but it is better if it is plowing. Even if the way is broken on a journey and hindered by such an encounter, this delay is compensated by the grace of this augury. Meeting a dog is favorable in a journey: when Cyrus was abandoned in the forest, he was nurtured by a dog until he came to his kingdom.#t_footnote(915)[53] Likewise, the angel, an associate of Tobias, did not despise the dog as a companion.#t_footnote(916)[54] A beaver, because it bites off its own testicles and leaves them for the hunters, is a bad omen: it predicts that a man will inflict ruin on himself.#t_footnote(917)[55]

    Among small animals, mice also signify ruin. When they chewed the gold in Rome, that same day both consuls were ambushed near Tarentum by Hannibal.#t_footnote(918)[56] Locusts, if making a stand or destroying a place, hinder prayers and are a bad omen. On the other hand, cicadas promote journeys and announce the good outcomes of things. Spiders, weaving their thread from above, are said to announce the coming of expected money. Similarly, ants, because they learned to provide for themselves and prepare a safe hiding place, portend security and wealth and signify a great army.#t_footnote(919)[57] Hence, when Tiberius Caesar saw that ants devoured a tame serpent,#t_footnote(920)[58] this sign told him to beware the tumult of the multitude.#t_footnote(921)[59]

He was told by a soothsayer that, depending upon if the male or female was released, either he or his wife would shortly die. Gracchus, preferring the life of his wife, killed the male and released the female. He died a little while later.#t_footnote(923)[61] A viper signifies crooked women#t_footnote(924)[62] and wicked children,#t_footnote(925)[63] and an eel signifies a man hostile to everything: indeed, they live separately from other fish.

    Among all auspices and omens, nothing is more effective than men, and nothing is more powerful, because truly nothing can be explained clearer. Therefore, diligently observe and seek his condition: life, sex, profession, structure, gestures, movements, exercise, complexion, habits, name, words, and speech. For, among other animals, in which so many presages are revealed, no doubt the most efficacious and clearest omens are those infused in the human soul: [Marcus] Tullius [Cicero] himself testified to this, saying that there is a certain divination naturally in the human soul that belongs to mankind eternally and allows us to recognize the sequence of all things and their causes.#t_footnote(927)[65] In the foundation of the city of Rome, the head of a man was found with his entire face: this portended the greatness of the empire and gave the name of the Capitoline hill. The soldiers of Brutus battling against Octavian and Marc Antony offended an Ethiopian in the entrance of their camp, whom they slaughtered. This [was seen] as an unfavorable augury, and thus their battle was unfavorable, and both Brutus and Cassius perished. Also, meeting monks is generally ominous, but more so if it happens early in the morning. This is because these kinds of men live much for the dead, just as vultures do for the slaughtered.#t_footnote(928)[66]

  #p_normal[
    Auspices and auguries, which foretell the future from animals and birds, we read were first demonstrated by the theologian Orpheus.#t_footnote(929)[1] Afterward, all great nations made use of them. But they are verified by the light of the natural senses. Certain lights of divination descending from above to quadrupeds, winged animals, and other beasts through which [creatures] they may portend to us human events.#t_footnote(930)[2] Virgil also seemed to perceive this, as he sang:
  ]
  #p_poetry[
    #emph[Nor do I believe that they have divine]

  #p_poetry[
    #emph[Knowledge, or a greater foresight of the fates of things.]#t_footnote(931)[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But these sorts of natural senses, as William of Auvergne said, are more sublime than all human understanding. Prophecy is the closest and most like it. From these senses there is a certain wonderful light of divination, which is naturally infused into certain animals: just as certain dogs can clearly sense and recognize thieves, hidden men, and men thoroughly unknown to them—thus, they discover, find, seize, and rush upon such people with their jaws and teeth.

    Similarly, vultures, with their senses, foresee future massacres from battles. They congregate in places where such events will happen, as they foresee future food for themselves from corpses. With the same senses, partridges recognize their [real] mother, who they have never seen, and abandon the [partridge] who stole their mother’s eggs and kept them warm.#t_footnote(932)[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    These same senses (the soul of man being entirely ignorant of them) perceive certain harmful and terrifying things, from where terror and horror possess many men, perceiving or considering none of these things. Thus, a robber hidden somewhere in a house, with no one knowing or thinking about it, strikes horror and terror and disturbs the heart of those dwelling in the house—perhaps not everyone, because that brilliance does not belong to all men but only a few. Thus, some are able to sense a prostitute hidden in a large house, while others are ignorant#t_footnote(933)[5] [of the prostitute’s presence].

    In histories, a certain Heraiscus from Egypt is named: a man with a divine nature, who could recognize an unclean woman not only with his eyes but also from hearing her voice from afar. Immediately, his head would hurt because that kind of thing did not affect him moderately.#t_footnote(934)[6] Likewise, William of Auvergne refers to a certain woman of his time who loved a man. When approaching a place where she stayed, with her senses, she could perceive him coming from two miles away.#t_footnote(935)[7]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    [William of Auvergne] also refers to a certain [female] stork, also in his time, who was convicted of adultery by a male who could smell it. The male gathered a multitude of storks and uncovered the crime of the female. That entire multitude judged the culprit guilty, then defeathered and mangled her.#t_footnote(936)[8] He also wrote of a certain horse, who was ignorant of his mother and had intercourse with her. Afterward, he understood this, and with his own teeth, tore off his genitals, as if he were punishing himself for incest.#t_footnote(937)[9] Similar horses were written about by Aristotle,#t_footnote(938)[10] Varro,#t_footnote(939)[11] and Pliny.#t_footnote(940)[12] Pliny himself wrote of a certain asp who acted in a similar way, who, after coming daily to a certain table in Egypt to feed, gave birth to some young, who killed one son of the host. The asp returned and recognized the crime, killed the young, and afterward never returned to the house.#t_footnote(941)[13]

  #p_normal[
    From these examples, we see how the lights of presages can descend over certain animals, such as signs of things in their movement, voice, flight, approach, food, color, and other agreements of this sort.#t_footnote(942)[14] For, according to the doctrine of the Platonists, there is a certain power engrafted into inferior things, which for the most part agree with their superiors. From these, the tacit consensus of animals seems to agree with the divine bodies, and these bodies and effects cause their strengths, whose names are ascribed by the divine.#t_footnote(943)[15]

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, we must consider which animals are Saturnine, which refer to Jupiter, which to Mars, and thus for all the rest, and according to their qualities elicit their prognostications. Thus, if referring to Saturn and Mars, it is said [to respond to] all dreadful and deadly birds, like the little owl, tawny owl, and others that are written about above. Similarly, the horned owl—because it is a solitary, nocturnal, and Saturnine bird—is considered an inauspicious omen, about which the poet said:

  #p_poetry[
    #emph[The filthy bird thus comes announcing grief,]

    Indeed, the swan is a delightful bird, Venusian, and also sacred to Phoebus. It is said to presage happiness, especially in auspices for sailors, because swans do not drown in water; as Aemilius#t_footnote(945)[17] sang:
  ]

  #p_poetry[
    #emph[In auspices, the swan is always the happiest bird.]#t_footnote(946)[18]

    There are also omenal songbirds,#t_footnote(947)[19] who make auspices through their mouth and sing, as with the raven, woodpecker, and crow;#t_footnote(948)[20] from Virgil:

  #p_poetry[
    #emph[Often the crow inauspiciously predicts from the hollow oak.#t_footnote(949)[21]]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, there are birds that predict by flight such as buzzards, ospreys, eagles, vultures,#t_footnote(950)[22] cranes, swans, and the like. Their flight is to be considered, whether flying slowly or quickly, whether flying from the left or right, and likewise how many of them are flying over. In this manner, cranes—when flying quickly—signify storms. When silent, [they signify] good weather. Likewise, two birds#t_footnote(951)[23] flocking together is deadly and is said to predict evil, because that is the number of confusion. Investigate the others in a similar way, transferring the rationale of the numbers here.

    But the most wonderful auguries are the kind that hear and understand the conversation of animals, as we read from the ancients Melampus, Tiresias, Thales,#t_footnote(953)[25] and Apollonius of Tyana, who excelled in understanding the conversations of birds. Philostratus and Porphyry wrote that once when Apollonius sat in the company of friends, he observed some sparrows sitting in a tree. Then, coming from elsewhere, a single sparrow chattered and made loud noises and flew away with the others following him. Then Apollonius said to his friends: “That sparrow reported to the others that near Rome an ass laden with wheat fell in a narrow street, and the wheat was spilled everywhere on the ground.” These words very much excited everyone, and they went to test this and thus found Apollonius’s words were fact.#t_footnote(954)[26] But the Platonist Porphyry in the third book of
    #emph[The Sacrifices] said that it was a swallow.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed this is certain, because every voice of each animal signifies some of the passions, dispositions, happiness, sadness, or anger of its soul. That their voices can be understood among trained men is no wonder.#t_footnote(955)[27] However, Pliny tells us that Democritus named certain birds that, when their blood was mixed by an art he handed down, this would beget serpents. Whoever ate of these understood the speech of birds.#t_footnote(956)[28] Hermes said that if on a certain day on the calends#t_footnote(957)[29] of November, one goes out to hunt birds, and then cooks the first bird captured with the heart of a fox, everyone who eats this bird will understand the voices of birds and other animals.#t_footnote(958)[30] Also, the Arabs wrote that they could understand the thoughts of beasts if the heart or liver of a serpent#t_footnote(959)[31] was consumed. Proclus the Platonist believed and wrote that the heart of a mole was good for predictions.#t_footnote(960)[32]

  #p_quote[
    #emph[The voices of animals signify the passions of its soul.]

    Also, there were divinations and auspices from the bowels and entrails taken from sacrifices, the inventor of which was Tages, of whom Lucan sang:

  #p_poetry[
    #emph[Was Tages . . .]#t_footnote(961)[33]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Roman religion believed that the liver was the head of the bowels. Hence, soothsayers, searching for the future in bowels, first examined the liver, which was made up of two heads: one of which was for the city, the other for enemies. These heads were collected together, and one or the other part proclaimed victory, just as from Lucan we read in his verses of the slaughter of Pompey’s men, and the victory of Caesar signified by entrails:
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[The liver is the head of the bowels.]
  ]
  #p_poetry[
    #emph[In the entrails were every sin, nothing was safe,]

  #p_poetry[
    #emph[Behold the head of the entrails’ swollen mass]

  #p_poetry[
    #emph[On one head; part is corrupted and hanging withered,]
  ]
  #p_poetry[
    #emph[The other part trembles and the veins prominently pulse.]#t_footnote(962)[34]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Then, the entrails completed, the heart was searched for; because, if the victim was found without one, or a head was missing in the liver, that was a disastrous auspice and were called expiatory.#t_footnote(963)[35] It was the same if the victim escaped from the altar, or made a loud cry when pierced, or fell on a different part of his body than he should.#t_footnote(964)[36]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    We read about Julius Caesar, that he appeared on a day in his purple robe and sat in his golden chair, but the sacrifices twice lacked a heart. C. Marius sacrificed at Utica, and it was found lacking a liver.#t_footnote(965)[37] It was the same with the prince Caius#t_footnote(966)[38] and M. Marcellus. C. Claudius and L. Petellius consulted with sacrificial victims, where the liver suddenly melted away: not much later one became sick, the other died in battle in Liguria.#t_footnote(967)[39] The entrails predicted this, because it was thought to proceed from a virtue of the gods or the work of daemons.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Hence, according to the ancients, it was always of greatest importance if something unusual appeared in entrails: as when Sulla sacrificed at Laurentum, the likeness of a crown appeared in the head of the liver, which the soothsayer Posthumius interpreted as victory for the kingdom and therefore suggested that only Sulla should eat the entrails.#t_footnote(968)[40] Also, the color of the entrails must be considered; as recalled by Lucan:
  ]
  #p_poetry[
    #emph[The color frightened the prophets: disgraced with pale]
  ]
  #p_poetry[
    #emph[Entrails marked with spots and infected with cold blood]

  #p_normal[
    So venerated were these arts in the past, that powerful and wise men pursued these. Indeed, senators and kings did not act without auspices. But all of these are neglected by the men of today. Regardless, the authority of the Fathers abolished them.

    Moreover, of the other auguries, the revealing of lightning and flashes and the knowledge of how to interpret their portents#t_footnote(970)[1] and prodigies, were handed down by Etruscan prophets and priests. Indeed, they set up sixteen regions of the sky, and divinities were appointed for each. In addition, there are eleven kinds of lightning and nine gods who throw them, and they created the reasoning for the significations of each part.#t_footnote(971)[2]

    However, revealing portents and prodigies, however often they happen, a great prediction is always certain. But their interpreter must be a good diviner of similarities, and also a careful investigator, and [know] of those who do business with princes and provinces of that time. Accordingly, the heavens only attend to princes, people, and provinces, as they prefigure and warn before the other stars, constellations, portents, and prodigies. Because, if the same thing or a similar [omen] has been seen in past generations, we must consider that, follow it, and according to this, predict the same or a similar thing, because the same signs are for the same things, and like for like.

    Thus, prodigies came before the birth or death of many eminent men and kings. Cicero recounts how when Midas was a young boy an ant threw grains of wheat in his mouth while he was sleeping, which was an omen of great wealth. While Plato was sleeping in the cradle, a bee landed on his mouth, foretelling the sweetness of his speech. When Hecuba was giving birth to Paris, she saw a burning torch, which would burn all of Troy and Asia. The mother of Phalarus saw an image of Mercury pouring blood on the ground, which flooded the entire house. The mother of Dionysus saw herself giving birth to a satyr,#t_footnote(972)[3] which was a prodigious dream that was proved by the event that followed. The wife of Tarquinius Priscus saw flames licking the head of Servius Tullius, predicting his kingdom.#t_footnote(973)[4] In a similar manner, as Aeneas disputed with his father, Anchises, about fleeing after the capture of Troy, there appeared a flame licking the top of Ascanius’s head, but not harming him. This portended the reign of Ascanius, so Anchises was persuaded to leave.#t_footnote(974)[5]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    All preceded and portended notable disasters and prodigies.#t_footnote(975)[6] Thus, we read in Pliny that while M. Attilius and C. Portius were consuls, it rained milk and blood, which foretold a strong pestilence that would fall upon Rome the following year. Likewise, in Lucania, it rained iron that was almost like sponges in the year before M. Crassus was killed in Parthia, and then all of the Lucanian army, which was a very numerous army, were killed. Likewise, while L. Paulus and C. Marcellus were consuls, it rained wool around the castle of Corisanus, where T. Annius would be killed by Milo the following year. Likewise, during the Cimbrian war, the rattle of armor and sound of trumpets were heard from the sky.#t_footnote(976)[7]

  #p_normal[
    And Livy [wrote] of the Macedonian war: “In the year that Hannibal died, it rained blood for two days.”#t_footnote(977)[8] Likewise, in the second Punic war, it was said that water mixed with blood fell from the sky like rain at the time Hannibal destroyed Italy.#t_footnote(978)[9] The Lacedaemonians shortly before the defeat of Leuctra heard the sound of arms in the shrine of Hercules, and at the same time in Thebes in the temple of Hercules, the double doors that were closed with bars opened themselves, and arms that were fixed to the wall were found on the ground.#t_footnote(979)[10]

    Moreover, the elements also teach us about fated events, of which there are four well-known divinations that are called geomancy, hydromancy, aeromancy, and pyromancy. Lucan [wrote of] the sorceress who seems to boast of these herself, saying:

  #p_poetry[
    #emph[Seas, plains, and rocks of Rhodope speak.]#t_footnote(980)[1]

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, the first is geomancy, the moving, rattling, swelling, trembling, tearing, making deep holes, exhaling vapors, and other impressions of the earth, indicate the future. The Arab Almadel handed down these arts to us.#t_footnote(981)[2] But there is another kind of geomancy, which is divined by inscribing certain forceful or chance pricks in the earth, of which we will not speculate here, but we will speak of this later among the lots.#t_footnote(982)[3]

  #p_quote[

  #p_normal[
    But hydromancy excels in prophecy through impressions of water, such as ebbing and flowing, raising and lowering, storms, colors, and the like. To these are also added visions that happen in water. The Persians discovered a kind of divination that was referred by Varro, where a boy saw an effigy of Mercury in water that predicted in 150 verses all of the events of Mithridates’ war.#t_footnote(983)[4]

  #p_quote[
    #emph[The kind of hydromancy called lecanomancy.]

    We also read that Numa Pompilius practiced hydromancy. Indeed, he elicited the images of gods in water and learned the future from them—and Pythagoras also practiced this art a long time after Numa.#t_footnote(984)[5] There was also a kind of hydromancy called lecanomancy that the Assyrians once held in great esteem. In that art, plates of gold, silver, and precious stones inscribed with certain images, names, and characters were placed into a basin full of water.#t_footnote(985)[6] It is said about this art that melted lead or wax was also cast into the water, and things that one desired to know were shown as notable images.

  #p_normal[
    There were also once prophetic springs, such as the Patraean fountain at Achaea,#t_footnote(986)[7] and, it was said, the water of Juno at Epidaurus,#t_footnote(987)[8] and many more of which we will speak later in the section on oracles. However, here we refer to the divination of fish, once captured by the Lycians
    in a place called Dina, near the sea in the sacred grove of Apollo in a
    hollowed-out place in the sand. When consulting about the future, one lowered
    roasted meat into the [hollow]. Suddenly, that place was filled with water and a
    great multitude of fish and strange figures unknown to men appeared. From these forms, prophets predicted the future. This was widely referred to by Polycharmus in the
    #emph[Lycian History] by Athenaeus.#t_footnote(988)[9]

    In a similar manner, aeromancy provides predictions through the impressions of air, through blowing of wind, through rainbows, halos, through mist and clouds, imaginations in clouds, and visions in the air.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Divination of fire is through impressions of fire, through comets, colors of fire, and through visions and imagination in fire. Thus, the wife of Cicero predicted the future, that the following year he would be consul. After certain sacrifices, as she wished in the ashes, she saw that flames suddenly burst forth.#t_footnote(989)[10] In this manner, Pliny said that [if fires kindled on the] earth are pale and hum, this will report storms. Also, rain is predicted if in a lamp, the flame twists and flies about. It portends wind if the flames go out in lamps or can scarcely be kindled. It is the same when sparks fly out in a mass, or when the coals stick to the pot when lifted, or when the fire has subsided and the embers shatter or send out sparks, or when the ash in the hearth solidifies, and when it glows excessively from the coals.#t_footnote(990)[11]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    To this is added capnomancy, which is said to be from smoke. One considers the colors of the flame and smoke, its sound and movement, when it rises straight or slanting or rolling in a circle, just as we read in Statius in his verses:

    Therefore, since the souls of all men are perpetual and likewise spirits obey all perfect souls, magicians think that perfect men, through the power of their souls, can restore their dying bodies in a certain way with other inferior souls and inspire them again: just as when the breath of a weasel is extinguished, the voice of their parent restores them to life, and a lion’s lifeless offspring is revived by the lion breathing on them.

We also read of others who were killed, and many days later live again, just as we read from Pliny of a man who was a consul from Aviola, of L. Lamia, C. Aelius Tubero, Corfidius, Gabienus, and many others.#t_footnote(995)[3] Similarly, Aesop the storymaker, Tindoreus, Hercules, and the Palici (the sons of Jupiter and Thalia) died and were revived again. Also, history shows that there were many who were brought to life again by magicians and physicians, such as Asclepius. We mentioned above#t_footnote(996)[4] of what Juba, Xanthus, and Philostratus [said] about Tillon, a certain Arab,#t_footnote(997)[5] and Apollonius of Tyana.#t_footnote(998)[6]

    We also read that a certain Glaucus was dead beyond all expectations, but a physician hastened to him with an herb called #emph[dragon,]#t_footnote(999)[7] which is said by some to have restored him to life. Others say the physician revived him with a medicine that tasted like honey, from which arose the proverb: “Glaucus was revived from drinking honey.”#t_footnote(1000)[8]

  #p_normal[
    Also, Apuleius referred to these kinds of rites of revivification, of which Zachlas the Egyptian prophet said: “The prophet thus propitiated with some small herb on the mouth of the corpse and placed another on the breast. Then turned toward the east or the rising of the majestic Sun, praying silently and making a venerable scene for prompting earnest excitement for such a miracle. Now the breast rose, now the healthy veins pulsed, now filled with the spirit of the body, and the corpse arose and the young man spoke.”#t_footnote(1001)[9] If this is true, it follows that dying souls are sometimes hidden in the body, where they are oppressed by a vehement ecstasy and freed from all corporeal actions as life, senses, and all movement desert the body. However, a person in that state is not truly dead but rather lying lifeless and seemingly dead for a long time.

    Often in times of pestilence we see, when bringing the dead to be buried, they come back to life in the grave. This also happens frequently to women who suffocate from problems with the womb.

    The rabbi Moses [Maimonides] said from the book of Galen, which the patriarch translated, that this happened to a man who had suffocated for six days, neither eating nor drinking, and his arteries were hard. He said in the same book that a man who was filled#t_footnote(1002)[10] and lost the pulse in his entire body; his heart did not move and he lay down as if dead. He said that [a man who suffers] an accidental fall from a high place, hears a great noise, or is submerged in water for a long time may fall into a faint for forty-eight hours and lay down as if dead, his face growing dusty and green. He wrote in the same book of a man who was buried seventy-two hours after death and thus killed, because he was buried alive. There are signs where one can recognize if someone is alive, although they lay down as if dead and surely [seem to be] dead, unless assisted or through blood-letting or other cures,#t_footnote(1003)[11] though these seldom happen. It is in this manner that the understandings of the magicians and physicians have revived the dead, as once when one was bitten and killed by a serpent, the tribes of the Marsorus and Psillorus restored them to life.#t_footnote(1004)[12]

  #p_normal[
    These kinds of ecstasies can last a long time, though a man can be observed as nothing else than dead, such as in dormice, crocodiles, and many serpents. These are asleep all winter, and while in a deep sleep they can scarcely be awakened by fire. I have seen a dormouse dissected and remain immobile as if dead. Then, when the members were placed in boiling water, the members showed life. Similarly—although this is difficult to believe—we read in proven histories of certain men who sleep for a long time, continuing to sleep for many years. However, when awakened, they show no effects of old age. Pliny testified of a certain boy, who when weary of heat from his journey, was said to have slept in a cave for fifty-seven years. We also read of Epimenides of Crete, who slept in a cave for fifty-seven years—hence the adage: “Sleeping more than Epimenides.”#t_footnote(1005)[13] M. Damascenus wrote that in his time in Germany, a weakened peasant slept under a mound of hay through the entire autumn, and then winter, and continued to sleep. Then in the summer when the hay was gradually eaten, he was discovered awake as if half dead and out of his wits. It is the confirmed opinion of the ecclesiastical histories of the seven sleepers, who slept for 196 years. In Norway,#t_footnote(1006)[14] there is a cave in a lofty seashore, as Paul the Deacon and Methodius the martyr write, seven sleeping men lay sleeping for a long time without any corruption, and often people assembled to strike them. Finally, neighbors set a penalty so that they would stop hurting them.#t_footnote(1007)[15]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Moreover, Xenocrates, who among philosophers is of no small reputation—thought that this long sleep was a certain natural penalty, to which that certain souls were obliged by eternity to be appointed. M. Damascenus himself proved that there are many possible reasons why that is entirely natural and should not be thought absurd, because with some there are certain agreements, such as many being without food and drink, do not make excrement, are without decay and corruption, and are able to sleep for many months. Whether this may happen from a person accidentally drinking some poison, contracting a sleep-inducing sickness, experiencing a certain deep fear, or similar causes, men sometimes sleep many days, years, or months according to the intention or remission of the power of their soul.

    Chapter 59. Of divination through dreams.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    There is a kind of divination that happens in sleep—that is, in dreams—and this is proved by the traditions of philosophers, the authority of theologians, the examples of history, and daily experience. I say dreams here, but these are not phantasms or sleepless visions.#t_footnote(1013)[1] Indeed, [phantasms and sleepless visions] are empty and are not divinations but instead arise from the remnants of wakefulness or disturbances of the body. Often, the body is oppressed, or has fortune (whether favorable or unfavorable) that forces the weary mind to remain awake, so that even though one sleeps one is cheated of proper rest by contrary circumstances.#t_footnote(1014)[2]
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Dreams.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, what I call dreams here are spiritual imaginations caused by celestial influences, which are beneficial to the soul and body. Indeed, the rules for interpreting these were discovered by astrologers who wrote about questions.#t_footnote(1015)[3] Yet these are insufficient, because these kinds of dreams come to be used by many men with many qualities of spiritual imagination and disposition.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Wherefore one cannot use the same common rule for each interpretation, but, according to the opinion of Synesius, when there are the same accidents, and similar things are similar to their like, then the same or similar visions often happen and are appointed the same or similar opinion, passion, fortune, action, and events. Finally, as Aristotle said, the senses confirm memory.#t_footnote(1016)[4] However, from memory the same thing often produces experience, and more experience gradually accumulates as skill and science. One must approach dreams with a similar reasoning.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Synesius said that everyone must observe their dreams and then the events of their live, committing these to memory and paying attention to certain observations, noting what is seen to happen in such events when asleep and awake and accumulating many kinds of rules to oneself regarding these things. When these are gathered, a certain divinatory skill and the interpretation of dreams gradually grows, provided one’s memory does not fade.#t_footnote(1017)[5]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But the most effective dreams are when the Moon runs through the ninth sign of the nativity, or during the [Solar] revolution of that year, or alternatively in the ninth sign from the sign of profection.#t_footnote(1018)[6] But the truest and most certain divination is not a natural or human skill but instead a purified mind being divinely inspired; however, we will consider and discuss prophecies and oracles elsewhere.

    Chapter 60. Of frenzy and divinations that happen when awake, of the power of the melancholy humor, which sometimes also allures daemons in the human body.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Moreover, [divinations] not only happen when sleeping but sometimes while awake. A relaxed mind is stimulated by divinatory impulses. Aristotle spoke of frenzy, which comes from melancholic humors as related to this kind of divination, as he teaches in the treatise #emph[On Divination,] saying: “Ones who have melancholy, because of their vehemence, are far better at conjecture, quick in their imaginings, and most easily receive impressions from the celestials.” And in #emph[Problems,] he said that the Sibyls, the Bacchides, Niceratus#t_footnote(1019)[1] from Syracuse, and Amon were natural diviners and poets because of their melancholic complexion.#t_footnote(1020)[2]
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Kinds of divinatory frenzy.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, the cause of frenzy, if it is from within the human body, is a melancholic humor. Indeed, this is not what they call black bile, which, according to natural philosophers and physicians, is an impetus for perverse and horrible things, inducing more than madness, but also enticing evil daemons to possess human bodies. Therefore, it should be understoond that here we are using the term #emph[melancholic humor] to refer to a natural substance called “white bile” [rather than black bile].
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed, this [white bile], when kindled and burning, stirs up frenzy and brings to us knowledge and divination.#t_footnote(1021)[3] This process is especially helped by the influence of some celestial—especially Saturn,#t_footnote(1022)[4] who is cold and dry just like a melancholic humor and has a daily influence on the melancholic person, increasing and preserving [those tendencies]. Additionally, since Saturn is the author of secret contemplations and separation from all public business and the highest planet, his soul revokes outward offices and is always secret. He rises from below, pulls himself higher, and grants knowledge and predictions of the future.#t_footnote(1023)[5] This is what Aristotle intended in his book #emph[Problems,] saying: “Of melancholy, some are made as if divine, predicting the future, and some are made poets.”#t_footnote(1024)[6]
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Melancholics possess a genius.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    He also said that all men in any excellent science, very much stand out as melancholic. Also, Democritus and Plato confirmed, saying that there are some melancholics who have such an excellent genius that they were seen as divine rather than men.#t_footnote(1025)[7] Thus, many melancholics at first stand out as undeveloped, inept, and insane. As they say, Hesiod, Ion, Tynnichus of Calcys, Homer, and Lucretius were often suddenly seized by a frenzy and, as poets, retreated and sang certain wonderful and divine things, which they themselves scarcely understood.#t_footnote(1026)[8] Of this, the divine Plato said in Ion: “Many prophets, after their attack of frenzy has relaxed, do not fully understand what they write. Yet each art is treated correctly in frenzy, because each artist by reading them decides this.”#t_footnote(1027)[9]
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[The command of the melancholic humor.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Additionally, we read that the command of the melancholic humor is so great that the force of celestial daemons is also sometimes seized into the human body. These daemons prompt and inspire men to rave and to declare many wonderful things, as mentioned by the ancients. It is thought that this happens under a threefold difference according to a threefold apprehension of the soul—that is, imaginative, rational, and mental.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, they say: when the soul is impelled by a melancholic humor, with nothing crossing the bounds of the body and chains of the members is entirely transferred to the imagination. It suddenly becomes a home for inferior daemons, from whom often wonderful manual skills are received. Thus, we see the most undeveloped of any man suddenly become an exceptional painter, an architect, or otherwise the possessor of some skill without training.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    When daemons of this kind portend the future to us, then they show disturbances of the elements and changes of times, such as rain, storms, floods, deaths, famine, and massacres [occurring] in the future, and the like, just as we read from Aulius Gellius about the priest Cornelius, who in the time of the conflict in Thessaly of Caesar and Pompey, was seized by a frenzy in Padua and foretold the time, order, and outcome of the battle.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, when the soul is entirely turned to reason, it becomes a home for middle daemons. Hence, natural and human things obtain knowledge and prudence; thus, we see some secluded men suddenly become exceptional philosophers, physicians, or orators, moreover, predicting the changes in kingdoms and rebuilding the world, as with the Roman Sibyl.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, when the soul entirely rises into the mind, then it becomes a receptacle of sublime daemons. From them, one learns divine secrets: for example, Divine law, angelic orders, and information for better understanding eternal things and the salvation of souls.#t_footnote(1028)[10] However, one predicts future prodigies or miracles, future prophets or changes of law according to God’s providence: thus the Sibyl predicted the arrival of Christ a long time before [his birth]. Thus, Virgil, understanding that Christ was about to be born, remembered the Sibyl of Cumae, and had Pollio sing:

    And somewhat later, suggesting that original sin would be void, said:

    And he adds that the fall of the serpent and the poison of the tree of death, or the tree of the knowledge of good and evil will be gone, saying:
  ]
  #p_poetry[
    #emph[The serpents and the deceitful poisonous herbs will die.]#t_footnote(1032)[14]

    Yet he implies that some small remnants of original sin will remain, as he said:

  #p_poetry[
    #emph[Yet some relics of ancient crimes are near.]#t_footnote(1033)[15]

  #p_normal[
    Finally, with great excitement the offspring shouts, he honors the race of God with these words:

  #p_normal[
    Also, there are certain predictions, which are divinations, confined between the middle of the natural and beyond the natural,#t_footnote(1035)[17] as in those who are near death and debilitated by old age. People in such states sometimes foresee the future because, as Plato says in the
    #emph[Republic,] when they are less shackled to their senses, their understanding is more acute. Because they are closer to the place where they must go, the chains are, as it were, a little more relaxed and not entirely liable to the body. Thus, such people are easily illuminated by divine revelations.#t_footnote(1036)[18]

    Chapter 61. Of the forming of man, of the outer and inner senses, of the mind, of the threefold appetite of the soul, and the passion of will.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    It is the opinion of certain theologians that God did not immediately create the body of primeval man but was assisted by the celestials, who composed and formed them from the elements. This was supported by Alcinous from the doctrine of Plato, thinking that God is the highest creator of the world, and that because of this all the gods and daemons he created were immortal; the other kinds of mortal animals were created by younger divinities by the mandate of the highest God, because if He created these, they would also be born immortal.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, the gods lent and bound earth, fire, air, and water to each other in certain portions, making one body from all, subjecting souls to their ministry, assigning each of their powers to each province. They assigned them to certain lowly and humble places, such as passion in the breast and desire in the womb; the more noble senses [they placed] in the head, as it is the summit of the entire body;#t_footnote(1037)[1] then [they created] the many organs of speech.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Which outer senses respond to the elements.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But the senses are divided into the outer and inner. The outer then, are divided into five notable parts, which equally have five organs or subjects, as if they were certain foundations. They are assigned and disposed thus, that they are to be collected in the most eminent parts of the body and likewise the purest.#t_footnote(1038)[2] Indeed, the eyes are arranged in the order of the highest place and are the purest. They are related to the natures of fire and light. Then the ears hold the second place and purity and are compared to air. The third position belongs to the nostrils, which hold the middle between air and water. However, the next is taste, which is denser and as a nature, similar to water. The last position is touch, diffused throughout the entire body. It has a density like earth.#t_footnote(1039)[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But the purest senses are those that are not close to the senses, but can perceive from a distance, such as seeing and hearing. Smell, through the medium of air, is perceived when not near. However, taste is not perceived
    unless close, but touch is according to both methods: for it is perceived when near the body, and just as sight distinguishes through the medium of air, thus also touch can perceive through the medium of a stick or rod, sensing hardness and dampness. However, touch is the only sense common to all animals. But certainly, man possesses this sense: inasmuch as in touch and taste [man] excels over the other animals. But in the other three senses, some other animals prevail, such as dogs who can see, hear, and smell more acutely than man. Likewise, lynxes and eagles can see more acutely than many other animals and man.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Man excels over other animals with taste and touch.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, the interior senses, as Averroes said, are in four parts. The first is called common, because it first collects and perfects all that is drawn through the external senses by images. The second is imaginative power, whose duty is, as it perceives nothing, to retain images accepted from the previous senses and pass them to the third nature of senses. [The third] is fantasy and the power of thought. Its work is to accept images, to perceive and judge the [reason and nature] of those images, and thus distinguish, connect, perceive, and judge by the fourth power—called memory—which is entrusted to protect#t_footnote(1040)[4] [those images]. The kinds of [fantasy] are wandering, arranging, pursuits, flights, and passions to action, but in type, [thoughts] are intellectual understanding, virtues, discipline, reasoning, deliberation, and choice.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But this is what shows us the future in dreams: imaginations that are sometimes called intellectual imaginations. Indeed, as Iamblicus said, these are the last traces of intelligence that belong to all powers of the intellect and which can fashion all forms, likeness of species, and operations and visions, or transmit the impressions of other strengths into others. These indeed vibrate the senses, and arouse them into belief (which is from the true intellect) and in the second place it offers to belief. But from itself, [the intellect] receives images from all, and through their quality, it appoints them according to their particular likeness. It forms all actions of the soul, and adapts the external to the internal, and also imprints impressions on the body.#t_footnote(1041)[5]
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Sense organs in the head.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    These senses have their organs in the head. Common sense with imagination has the front portions in the brain, although Aristotle placed the organ of common sense in the heart. The power of thought has the top and middle parts of the head and then memory has the back.#t_footnote(1042)[6]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Again, the organs of voice and conversation are many—accordingly, inside the breast between the ribs, muscles, breasts, lungs, throat, arteries, jaws, and especially those that are the gristle for vibrating strings,#t_footnote(1043)[7] the plectrum of the tongue, and all those small parts and muscles that are the organs for blowing.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, the special organ for conversation is the mouth, in which conversation, words, and speech are formed and shaped. The tongue and windpipe together are the plectrum, and the palate makes the sound. The teeth and mouth open, like the vibrating strings on a lyre, and the nose is above for good melodiousness or uniting the cheeks.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[The mind has a double nature.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Over the sensible soul, which exhibits its powers through the organs of the body, the incorporeal mind occupies the highest place. It has a double nature. One side of that nature presides over inquiry into the order of nature, causes, qualities, and progressions. It is satisfied in the contemplation of truth, and is therefore called the “contemplative intellect.” The other side is the nature or power of mind, which distinguishes by consulting those things that must be done, and those that should be avoided. The entirety of this consultation and action is maneuvered and is therefore called the active intellect.#t_footnote(1044)[8] Therefore, nature set up this order of powers in men, so that through the exterior senses we might recognize corporeal things and by the interior senses the likeness of bodies, as well as those [things] abstracted by the mind or intellect, which are not bodies and not like them.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Like the threefold order of the powers of the soul, there are three appetites found in the soul. The first is natural, which is a certain inclination of nature toward its limit, such as stone [has a] downwards [nature] that belongs to all stones. The other is animal, which follows the senses, and is divided into the irascible and concupiscible.#t_footnote(1045)[9] The third is the intellectual, which is called the will. This is different from the sensitive, which is through those things that can be offered to the senses, desiring nothing unless comprehended in some way. However, the will—although by it all things are possible—because it is free in essence, it can also attempt the impossible, such as a daemon striving to be equal with God.#t_footnote(1046)[10] It is therefore altered and depraved with continuous pleasure and pain while it assents to the inferior powers.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[The threefold appetites in the soul.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    From its depraved appetites come four passions, which similarly sometimes affect the body. The first of which is called delight, which is a certain softness and compliance of mind or will, where just as the senses extend sweetness, it most willingly consents, obeys, and yields. Therefore, this is defined as an inclination of the mind to achieve pleasure.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The second is called effusion, which is the remission or disintegration of virtue—that is, when beyond delight, the entire power of the mind and intention of the present, sweet goodness dissipates, descends, and diffuses itself and brings about its enjoyment.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The third is called pride—that is, the eagerness of recognition, greatly valuing the attainment of a certain good for oneself, possessing oneself haughtily, exaltating in this, and craving idle glory.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The fourth and last is called spite, which is a certain pleasure of evil to another without any benefit to oneself. It is said to be without any benefit to oneself, because if one is happy at some evil suffered by another because it proves useful to one’s own self, this is better, [as it is] out of love for oneself rather than malice toward another.#t_footnote(1047)[11]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    For these four passions, born from a depraved appetite of pleasure, are found as many pains opposite to the passions, such as horror, sadness, fear, and resentment of another’s good without detriment of himself, which is called envy. This is sorrow at another’s good, just as pity is a certain sadness of another’s misfortune.

  ]
  #p_normal[
    The passions of the mind are nothing else than certain movements or inclinations coming from the apprehension of some thing, as it were, good or evil, or agreeing or not agreeing. Apprehensions of this kind are threefold—that is, sensual, rational, and mental. After these are three passions of the soul. Whenever [these passions]
    follow the sensitive apprehension, they then consider the good or temporal evil
    under an agreeable or disagreeable, delectable or offensive rationale. Such
    passions are called natural or animal. On the other hand, when passions instead
    follow a rational apprehension and thus consider good or evil under a reason of
    virtue and sin, praise and reproach, usefulness and uselessness, or honor and disgrace, they are called rational or voluntary passions. Whenever they follow a mental apprehension and consider good and evil under a rationale of justice and injustice, or truth and falsehood, they are called intellectual passions or conscience.#t_footnote(1048)[1]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But the subject of the passions of the soul is the concupiscent#t_footnote(1049)[2] power of the soul and is divided into the concupiscent and the irascible. Each considers good and evil, but differently. Indeed the concupiscent power, whenever considering good and evil absolutely, causes love, or desire, and to the contrary hatred; or they consider good as absent, and thus causes lust, or a feeling of loss, and evil as absent, but as threatening, and thus causes horror, flight, and aversion; or they consider good and evil as present and advancing, and thus with good rising as delight, joy, pleasure, then with evil sadness, difficulty, and pain. But the irascible power considers good and evil under the rationale of difficulty for gaining
    or obtaining, fleeing or expelling. This sometimes [rises] with confidence, and thus indeed causes hope, then boldness; whenever with mistrust, thus arises desperation and dread or fear. And whenever that irascible power rises in vengeance, this only happens around past evil, such as with inflicted injuries or attacks, and causes anger.

  #p_normal[
    And thus, we find eleven passions in the mind, which are love, hate, loss, horror, joy, pain, hope, desperation, boldness, fear, and anger.#t_footnote(1050)[3]

    Thus, spirits are expelled in joy, retracted in fear, and moved to the brain in modesty. Thus, in joy, the heart gradually grows outward, and in sadness, it gradually constricts inward. [This] likewise [happens] with anger or fear, but in a sudden way.

    Anger or lust for vengeance produces heat, redness, a bitter taste, and a flux in the belly. Fear induces cold, trepidation in the heart, a failing voice, and pallor. Sadness induces sweat and a bluish white. Pity, which is a certain sadness, often induces an evil effect in the body, as it affects other bodies seeing it.#t_footnote(1051)[1] It is likewise widely known that, among some lovers, there is such a strong bond of love that when one suffers the other suffers.#t_footnote(1052)[2] Likewise, anxiety induces dryness and blackness.#t_footnote(1053)[3]

    Also, physicians recognize that such great heat of amorous lust stirs up in the liver and the pulse.

    Additionally, it is undoubted that passions of this kind, when violent, can cause death. This is plain to all people. Excessive joy, sadness, love, and hatred sometimes kill men,#t_footnote(1055)[5] and also often lift sickness. Thus, we read that Sophocles and Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, each received the announcement of a tragic victory and suddenly died. Thus, also a mother, when seeing a son returning from the battle of Cannae, suddenly died.

    Everyone knows what sadness can do. We also know that dogs often die from excessive sadness from the death of its owner. Sometimes from these kinds of passions, lasting diseases follow. In other cases, ailments are sometimes cured. Some people, when looking down from heights, shake from excessive fear, become dizzy, weaken, and lose their senses. Sobbing and fever sometimes follow epilepsy. However, when they recede, sometimes certain wonderful effects emerge. Such was the case with the son of Croesus, who was born from his mother mute: violent fear and desire shook out his voice, which nature denied long ago.#t_footnote(1056)[6] Thus, it often happens that due to a certain sudden accident, life, senses, and sudden movement of members leave and then suddenly return.

    Also, what such noble spirit connected with violent anger can accomplish is shown in Alexander the Great. When he was surrounded in a battle in India, he was seen to have light and fire pouring from him.

Things like these sometimes also appear in beasts, such as the horse of Tiberius, who projected flames from his mouth.#t_footnote(1057)[7]

  #p_normal[
    The passions mentioned above sometimes alter the body through imitation according to the virtue that has a similarity to the thing changing it, which vehemently moves the imagination. For example, numbing and freezing the teeth from some sight or sound, or because we see or imagine another eating sharp things. As seeing another yawn also makes one yawn, and upon hearing the name of something sour, the tongue becomes sour; also troubling, when seeing
    something foul corrupts the stomach and causes nausea; and some will faint when
    seeing human blood. Some, when seeing bitter food presented, will perceive a bitter taste.#t_footnote(1058)[1] William of Auvergne wrote that he saw a man who, by only seeing medicine, was moved to purge as often as he needed to. Yet this was not with the substance of medicine, not tasting it, and not by its scent coming to him, but only by seizing its likeness through imagination.#t_footnote(1059)[2]

    Sometimes human bodies are transformed, transfigured, and transported—indeed, often in dreams and also sometimes while awake. Thus, Cippus,#t_footnote(1060)[3] after he was chosen as king of Italy, with exceeding admiration considered the fighting and victory of bulls. With that on his mind, he fell asleep at night, and in the morning, he found that he bore horns, and they were from nowhere other than from the invigorating virtue, stimulated by vehement imagination, elevating horned humors in his head to produce horns.

    Indeed, vehement thought, while violently changes the appearance, paints a representation of the thing thought about in blood. That [blood] is nourished from itself and impresses itself on its own members,#t_footnote(1061)[4] and also sometimes another’s, just as the imagination of a pregnant woman imprints onto the fetus notable things she desires and the imagination of one bitten by a dog impresses onto their urine the image of a dog. Thus, many will grow old suddenly. Some, from the dreams of one night, have grown from boys to complete men. Also, according to this, are the many scars from the desires of King Dagobert and the stigmata of Saint Francis: the former while greatly fearing rebuke, the latter while vehemently meditating on the wounds of Christ.

    Thus, many are transported from place to place, crossing rivers, fire, and inaccessible places—that is, when any kind of vehement desire, fear, or boldness impresses on the spirit, mixes with vapors, and moves the organ of touch in their origin together with imagination, which is the source of local motion. From here they stir up the members and organs of movement to move and are moved without error to the imagined place—indeed, not by sight but from inner imagination.#t_footnote(1062)[5] So great is the power of the soul in the body that, in whatever direction one imagines or dreams, the body likewise elevates and is led. We read many other examples, in which the power of the soul in the body is wonderfully explained, such as what Avicenna wrote of a certain man, who whenever he wished, could inflict his body with paralysis.

    It is said of Gallus Vibius that he once fell into madness, not by accident but reaching it by judgment; for, while imitating madness, his thoughts were lured to the character of madness, and this simulated madness became true. And Augustine referred to certain men who could move their ears at will, and who could move the top of their head entirely downward to their forehead and back again when they wished, and others who could sweat at will. It is likewise notable that some can cry at will and shed tears abundantly. Some are found who can bring up what they have swallowed whenever they please, little by little as if from a purse. And today we see many who can imitate and portray birds, cattle, dogs, and men with their voices as if they are invisible.#t_footnote(1063)[6]

    But no one ignores how much imagination can do in the soul.

    Thus, the soul, sometimes through vehement imagination or speculation, is entirely removed from the body. This is just what Celsus wrote of a certain priest who—as often as he pleased—was able to remove his senses and lied down as if dead. When pricked and burned, he could not perceive any pain and lay immobile and without breathing. Yet he said afterward that he could hear men’s voices, if they were crying out loudly, as it were from far away.#t_footnote(1068)[11] However, we will discuss these separations in more detail later.

    Passions of the soul that follow imagination, when most vehement, not only change one’s own body but can also move across to operate in another’s body.#t_footnote(1069)[1]
    Therefore, certain wonderful impressions are produced in elements and external things, and also certain illnesses of the mind or body can thus be taken away or brought.#t_footnote(1070)[2] Passions of the soul are the most prominent cause of temperament in one’s own body. Thus, the soul, strongly elevated and inflamed by vehement imagination, brings health or illness—not only in one’s own body but also in another’s body.#t_footnote(1071)[3]

    Thus, Avicenna thought that a camel can be killed from the imagination of anyone.#t_footnote(1072)[4] Thus, when one is bitten by a rabid dog, the figure of a dog appears in their urine. Thus, a lusting pregnant woman can act upon another’s body, afflicting the fetus in the womb by marking it with the thing desired.#t_footnote(1073)[5]
    Thus, many monstrous generations are produced from pregnancies with monstrous imaginations. Such a case was referred to by Marcus Damascenus at Petra Sancta, a town situated in the confines of Pisa [province], that King Charles, emperor of Bohemia, was offered a girl whose entire body was shaggy and covered with hair like a wild beast. Her mother had a certain religious dread of the image of John the Baptist, which was near her bed during conception. This afterward affected her [pregnancy] and produced such [a child].

    The phenomena I have described does not only occur in men. We may also see it happen in brutish animals. Thus, we read that Jacob the patriarch, throwing twigs in the water, discolored the sheep of Laban.#t_footnote(1074)[6] Thus, peacocks and other different birds, when lying together, imprint their color upon each other’s feathers from the power of their strong imaginations, which produces white peacocks when the birds are lying together in a home with white linens hanging nearby.

    Now, in these examples, it is shown how the affection of imagination, where it intends most vehemently, not only affects one’s own body but also another’s. Thus, enchanters who desire to destructively bewitch men harm them with a fixed gaze.#t_footnote(1075)[7] Avicenna, Aristotle, Algazel, and Galen assent to the same.#t_footnote(1076)[8] Indeed, it is known that a body is most easily corrupted by illness from the vapors of another body, which we plainly see in plague and leprosy. Again, vapors of the eyes are of such great power that they can bewitch and corrupt those who are near. The basilisk and catoblepas#t_footnote(1077)[9] kill men with their glance, and certain women from Scythia among the Illyrians and Triballi kill with their gaze when they are angry.#t_footnote(1078)[10]

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, no one should marvel that the body and soul of one can affect the mind of another, since the mind is by far more powerful, stronger, more fervent, and moves more strongly than vapors exhaling from bodies. Nor are bodies lacking through the means by which they operate, and nor is a body less subject to another’s mind than to another’s body.#t_footnote(1079)[11]

  #p_normal[
    In this way, it is said that a man, with only his disposition and character, can act upon others. Therefore, philosophers warn us to flee far away from consorting with evil and unfortunate men. Accordingly, these souls are full of noxious rays poisoning those near with ruinous influences. On the contrary, they teach that we should strive to consort with the good and happy [men], because their closeness is more useful to us. Indeed, such as scent [comes] from asafoetida or musk; thus, evil comes from something evil and from the good comes something good, jumping to the nearest, and sometimes persistently infuses things for a long time.

We read from Apollonius, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Philolaus, and many prophets of our sacred religion that wonders have happened in this way.#t_footnote(1080)[12] Of these, we will expand later, in our discussions on religion.

    The passions of the mind are very much helped by the heavens and become helpful and very powerful inasmuch as they agree with the heavens or as a certain natural pact, voluntary election, or free will.

    Therefore, it is greatly conducive in any work for receiving the benefit of the heavens, if, in our thoughts, dispositions, imaginations, elections, deliberations, contemplations, and the like, we excel in being harmonious with the heavens. Indeed, passions of this sort vehemently excite our spirit toward their like and suddenly expose us to our superiors, which signify those kinds of passions. Then, because of their dignity and closeness with the superiors, our thoughts capture the power of the celestials much more, and do so to a much greater extent than any material thing can.

    Indeed, our mind, through imagination or reason, can conform to some star by a certain imitation, so that it is suddenly filled with the gifts of that same star, as it were, [becoming] a receptacle of its own influence. However, the contemplating mind, inasmuch as it removes and separates itself from all senses, imagination, nature, and deliberation, recollects itself—unless it exposes itself to Saturn,#t_footnote(1081)[1] which is not of the present investigation. Indeed, our mind works much through faith, which is a firm link, a fixed intention, and vehement application of the operation or undertaking in whatever thing cooperating with and giving power to the work that we intend to accomplish, so that an image of the virtue being received is made in us in a certain way and creates things in us or from us.#t_footnote(1082)[2] Therefore, we must vehemently aspire, imagine, expect, and firmly believe in any operation and thing applied.

    Philosophers, especially the Arabs, say that the human mind—when made attentive by its passions and dispositions toward some work—connects with the mind of the stars, and also with their intelligences. Likewise, that connection is a cause, as certain wonderful virtues are infused into our operations and into things,#t_footnote(1086)[1] because with them is an apprehension and power in all things. This is so because there is a natural obedience in all things to the stars and this has the natural effect [of motivating] movement toward that which the mind strongly desires when it is aligned with them.#t_footnote(1087)[2] Accordingly, it is verified that the mind is affected by the art of certain characters, images, incantations, sermons, and many other wonderful experiments.

  #p_normal[
    Indeed, anything which then acts and dictates from characters, figures, words, sermons, gestures, and the like, helps the appetite of the soul and acquires certain wonderful virtues. In such a manner, the mind is moved by the soul of the worker, which is overtaken in that hour when the right celestial influences [are in operation] and the appetite of the soul is greatest. Indeed, our mind, when carried in any great excess of some passion or virtue, often seizes for itself a stronger, better, and more appropriate hour or opportunity. Thomas Aquinas acknowledged this in the third book of
    #emph[Against the Gentiles].#t_footnote(1088)[3]

    Thus, many wonderful virtues cause and follow certain wonderful virtues through great affections in those things, which the soul then dictates to them in that hour.

    Also, in the minds of men, there is a certain virtue for changing, attracting, impeding, and binding things and men toward that which it desires. All things obey them when they are carried in great excess by some passion or virtue in such an amount that it overcomes that which it binds.#t_footnote(1090)[1] Indeed, the superior binds the inferior and changes it to itself, and the inferior by the same reason changes toward the superior or is otherwise affected or stirred.

  #p_normal[
    For this reason, things whose superiors hold the qualities of some star by a degree, bind, attract, or impede things, which have an inferior, according to how they agree or disagree with each other.#t_footnote(1091)[2] Hence, lions fear roosters because the inherent Solar virtue agrees more in roosters than lions.#t_footnote(1092)[3] Thus, magnets draw iron because, in their order, they have a greater degree of the Celestial Bear. Thus, diamonds impede magnets because, in their order, they have a greater degree of Mars.

  #p_normal[
    In a similar way, when suitable, celestial gifts are exposed to any man by the affections of his mind as well as through due application of natural things. If he becomes stronger in a Solar virtue, he binds and draws inferiors in admiration and obedience; in the order of the Moon for servitude or illness; in Saturn for silence or sadness; in Jupiter for exhibiting veneration; in Mars for fear or discord; in Venus for love or joy; in Mercury for persuasion and compliance and the like.#t_footnote(1093)[4]

  #p_normal[
    It should now be plain that there is a great virtue residing in the dispositions of the mind. Additionally, you must understand that there is no less virtue in words and the names of things, and there is a great virtue included in speech and orations.#t_footnote(1097)[1] It is in this that we chiefly differ from beasts. We are called rational not from [mere] reasoning, which obeys according to the soul, and which they say contains affections, and which Galen also said we have in common with bestial animals (although one greater, the other less). But we are said to be rational for the reason that the voice is understood in words and speech, which is called “enunciative reason.” This is the part that far surpasses the other animals:#t_footnote(1098)[2] for, λόγος#t_footnote(1099)[3] is pronounced in Greek for reason, speech, and words.#t_footnote(1100)[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But [logos] is a twofold word—that is, internal and spoken. The internal word is a conception of the mind and moved by the soul, in which the power of thought is made without a voice. For instance, in dreams we seem to speak and discuss, and while awake we often run through an entire speech silently. But the spoken word has a certain quality of action. Speaking, the breath of man and the opening of his mouth produce vocalizations coming forth from his tongue. By obedience to natural laws, the corporeal voice connects to the speech of the mind and intellect, making it an enunciator and interpreter of the conceptions of our intellect to the listeners, which is what we speak of here.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, words are the most suitable medium between the speaker and listener. They convey with them not only a concept but also the virtue of the speaker, which is transferred and accepted by the listener with a certain efficacy. This often occurs with such great power that it not only changes the listeners but also certain other bodies and inanimate things. But those words which express greater things (for example, intellectual, celestial, and supernatural) have a greater effectiveness than the rest and also the more mysterious, when represented by a worthy tongue and established by a more sacred authority. Indeed, these are signs, representations, or sacraments of heavenly things. Such words hold a supernatural power. Explaining the virtues of things causes the power of those virtues to be engrafted to the words spoken, and thus they act as a vehicle by which those virtues are prepared and set forth.#t_footnote(1101)[5]

    Nearly everyone testifies that the names of particular things are greatly necessary for magical operations. For the natural power of things proceeds first from objects to the senses, then from [the senses] to the imagination, and finally from [the imagination] to the mind, where indeed it is first conceived, then pronounced through the voice and words. Therefore, the Platonists said that the voice itself, or words, or names, are formed with its parts from the power of the thing under the form of the signification. Some ancillary life, first conceived in the mind as if from a seed of things [created] again through voices or words (as if producing a birth), and finally kept in writings.#t_footnote(1102)[1]
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[The particular names of things are certain rays.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Hence, magicians say that the names of particular things are certain rays, always present everywhere, keeping the strength of things, inasmuch
    as they are the essence ruling the thing signified. This essence discerns and
    recognizes things through names, as it were, through particular and living
    images. Indeed, as influences from the heavens and elements, with the virtues of
    the planets, the Highest Maker produced different species and particular things.
    Thus, according to the same influxes and influences, the qualities of the
    particular names of things are reverberated and imposed, “by he who numbers the
    entire multitude of the stars, calling them by their names”; of which names Christ elsewhere says: “Your names are written in the heavens.” Therefore, knowing these celestial influences and qualities of singular things, the Creator first assigned the names of things according to their essence, as it is written in Genesis, because God brought all things He created into the presence of Adam so that he could name them; and as he called the thing, they were named;#t_footnote(1103)[2] which certain names surely contain wonderful powers in things signified.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, all signifying voices first signify through the influences of celestial harmony, second through the application of man, although more often otherwise by this and by that. However, when both significations coincide in some voice or name, assigned from the celestial harmony and from men alike, then it is a double virtue—that is, natural and voluntary. Those names are made most effective for acting, as often as they are mentioned in the appropriate place, time, and solemnity, with an exact intention in disposing the matter, and from the nature given by them.#t_footnote(1104)[3]

When they learned it, the Romans then summoned the god guarding the city with certain songs and cursed the inhabitants of that city.

    Beyond the virtues of words and
    names, other greater virtues are found in complex orations from truth contained
    in them. They impress a greater power. By changing, binding, establishing, and being used, it makes them shine more. Fighting against them strengthens and solidifies them more. However, these virtues are not in simple words but rather in phrases from which something is affirmed or denied.#t_footnote(1108)[1] Of this kind are songs, incantations, curses, orations, invocations, entreats, appeals, exorcisms, and the like.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, in composing songs and orations for attracting the virtue of any star or god, one must diligently consider which virtues, effects, and operations each star contains and engraft them in the songs. This is accomplished by praising, extolling, amplifying, and adorning that which the star typically brings about and influences, while suppressing and rejecting that which the star typically destroys and impedes.#t_footnote(1109)[2] Pray and implore for that which one desires to gain; reprimand and detest that which one desires to destroy and impede. With that method, you must compose an ornate and elegant oration to song, with distinct resolved parts, and with agreeable numbers and proportions.

  #p_normal[
    Additionally, magicians decree that one must invoke and entreat [the stars] from the names of that same star or god to which such song holds, from their wonders or miracles, by their courses and ways in their sphere, through their light, from their noble rulership, through the grace and clarity that is in them, from their power and wonderful virtues, and from similar things to these. As from Apuleius, Psyche entreated Ceres: “I ask you from your fertile right hand, I resolutely pray by joyful harvest ceremonies, by silent secret chests, by the winged chariots of your dragon servants, the furrows of the Sicilian fields, grasping chariots, clinging earth, illuminating nuptials of Proserpina’s descent, your daughter’s return to luminous discovery, and other things silently held in your sanctuary at Eleusis in Attica.”#t_footnote(1110)[3] Additionally, with the many names of the stars, they also order us to invoke by the names of the intelligences presiding over the stars, of which we will speak more in their place. But if one wishes more of these examples, they must search the hymns of Orpheus, of which nothing is more effective in natural magic, if due harmony is used with full attention with other circumstances, as wise men know.#t_footnote(1111)[4] But we must return to our subject.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, suitable songs of this kind duly composed for the rule of the stars, full of meaning and feeling, recited with suitable vehement affection, and then according to their signification, to the number and proportion of their parts, to the form resulting from their parts, and through the impetus of the imagination, accords a strong power in incantations, and immediately transfers into the thing enchanted to bind and direct it in the direction the affection of the speech and incantation is intended.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, the instrument of the incantation is a certain pure spirit: harmonious, warm, breathing, and living; it brings with it movement, affection, and signification. Its parts are composed and endowed with sense, and finally conceived with reason. Therefore, from this spiritual quality, and by celestial similarity (besides what has been said) and also from the appropriate time, songs receive from the heavens excellent virtues—indeed, more sublime and efficacious than spirits and vapors evaporating from vegetable life, from herbs, roots, gums, aromatics, fumigations, and the like.#t_footnote(1112)[5]

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, when magicians enchant things, they often blow and breathe onto them words of songs, as if breathing the virtue of the spirit, so that the entire virtue of the soul is directed into the thing enchanted, disposing it for accepting said virtues. And it must be noted that all orations, writings, and words, as by their customary numbers, proportions, and forms, induce movements. Thus, besides their usual order, they also proceed or write backward for bringing about uncustomary movements.#t_footnote(1113)[6]

    Also, all poets sing, and philosophers do not deny that songs bring about many wonders, such as banishing crops, collecting or causing lightning, curing illness, and the like. Cato, in
    #emph[Rustic Things,] used certain incantations against illnesses of beasts,#t_footnote(1125)[12] which are recorded in his writings. Likewise, Solomon was experienced in incantations of this kind, as Josephus testified. Celsus Africanus likewise wrote about Egyptian doctrine, that [the parts of] the human body (just as the number of decans of the signs of the zodiac are thirty-six) are attended by [an equivalent number of] daemons, each of which supports and protects his own part, whose names are called in the name of their homeland#t_footnote(1126)[13] and are invoked in incantations to restore impaired parts of the body and restore health.#t_footnote(1127)[14]

    The purpose of words and speech is to articulate the interior of the mind, to bring forth a secret inner understanding, and to spread the will of the speaker.#t_footnote(1128)[1] But writing is the highest expression of the mind: the cadence of style and tone, recapitulation, position, conclusion, central argument, and composed by a habitual repetition, which is not accomplished by voice alone. Whatever is in the mind, in voice, in word, in speech, in conversation—everything and all of these are also in writing. Thus, there is nothing that is conceived in the mind, pronounced in voice, and can be expressed that cannot also be written.

    Therefore, magicians command that in any operation one must make imprecations and inscriptions with which they may express affection. For example, if herbs or stones are collected, he must mention what use it is for; if one makes an image, they must speak and inscribe what effect is to happen.#t_footnote(1129)[2]

    Indeed, of imprecations and inscriptions, Albertus in #emph[Speculum] likewise does not disagree.#t_footnote(1130)[3] Without such things, our works would not be brought into completion, as an orderly arrangement does not cause an effect, but the act [causes] an orderly arrangement.

    God has given man a mind and speech, which (as Hermes Trismegistus said) are thought to be a gift of the same virtue, power, and immortality.#t_footnote(1134)[1] However, the omnipotent God Himself, by His providence, divided the speech of men into different languages. Indeed, with these languages, according to their diversity, they have likewise received different and individual letters for writing, constant in their certain reliable order, number, and figures, not accidental, by chance, nor from the fragile will of man, but divinely disposed and formed, agreeing with the celestials and the divine bodies and virtues themselves.

  #p_normal[
    However, among all languages Hebrew is notable as the most sacred of all writings.#t_footnote(1135)[2] In the figures of [Hebrew] characters, vowel stops, and accent points, just as consisting in matter, form, and spirit, the positions of the stars were first noted down in the seat of God, which is heaven. According to these figures, as Hebrew teachers testify, are the most fully formed letters of the celestial mysteries. [Such mysteries are shown] through their figure, form, and signification, then through the numbers signified by them, then through the various harmony bound in them.#t_footnote(1136)[3] The more secret Hebrew mekubalim assert that everything can be explained from the figures of their letters, forms of their characters, and their signature, simplicity, composition, separation, crookedness, direction, defect, abundance, largeness, smallness, crown, opening, closing, order, changing, connecting, revolutions, points, tops of the letters,
    and computation of the numbers signified by the letters. This is because these
    characteristics proceed from the First Cause and repeatedly renew themselves thereby.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Hebrew letters are the most sacred.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Additionally, Hebrews distribute the letters of their alphabet in three ways: that is, the twelve simple, seven doubles, and three mothers, which they signify as characters of things—the twelve signs, seven planets, and three elements—that is, fire, water, and earth, for air is not an element but is like a glue and spirit for the elements.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    To these, they arrange points and tops. Therefore, the names of all things are appointed from the characters and points of these letters and thus from the aspects of planets and signs, and likewise from the elements, the Maker, the spirit, and truly all that has been and will be,#t_footnote(1137)[4]
    signifying those [things] that are produced, and just as a certain sacrament and vehicle for explaining things, they bring their essence and strength everywhere with them.#t_footnote(1138)[5]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    These profound perceptions and sacraments are inherent in these characters and figures, and their numbers, structure, order, and revolution.#t_footnote(1139)[6] Origen, therefore, thought that names translated into other languages retain little of their own power, because they do not retain their natural signification.#t_footnote(1140)[7] Indeed, only original names, which are rightly imposed because they naturally signify, have a natural function. It is not so in those [names] which signify [only] from pleasure, that do not have the function they signify, but as they are certain natural things in themselves.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But if there is a first and causal language, whose words have a natural signification, it is agreed that this is Hebrew,#t_footnote(1141)[8] whose order is indeed profound. It is held as a root, and its letters are known to revolve.#t_footnote(1142)[9] They are the standard and rule of any perfectly invented language.#t_footnote(1143)[10] Therefore, there are twenty-two letters that are the foundation of the world and all creations that are named in it: all that is said and created in the world is obtained from their revolutions, names, and strengths.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But the investigator must search them for a long time by combining single letters, until which time the voice of God is revealed and opens the most sacred texts of the letters. Indeed, voices and words have efficacy in magical operations, because in them the first magic nature exercises, is the voice of God.#t_footnote(1144)[11] But these are of a higher speculation than what is handled in this book.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But now we return to the distribution of letters. Of these the Hebrew three mothers are
    א ,ו ,י the seven doubles,
    ב ,ג ,ד ,כ ,פ ,ר ,ת then the remaining twelve, ה ,ז ,ח ,ט ,ל ,מ ,נ ,ס ,ע ,צ ,ק ,ש are simple;#t_footnote(1145)[12] there is an equal rationale among the Chaldeans.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    From these, other languages likewise imitated and distributed their letters with the signs, planets, and elements in a certain order. For instance, from the Greek, Α, Ε, Η, Ι, Ο, Υ, Ω respond to the seven planets; Β, Γ, Δ, Ζ, Κ, Λ, Μ, Ν, Π, Ρ, Σ, Τ are attributed to the twelve signs of the zodiac; the other five, Θ, Ξ, Φ, Χ, Ψ, represent the four elements and World Spirit.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, Latin is similar to these, but they are signified in another order. For instance, the five vowels A, E, I, O, U, and I and U consonants are ascribed to the seven planets; however, the consonants B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, R, S, T preside over the twelve signs; the rest—that is, K, Q, X, Z—make the four elements. The aspirant H represents the World Spirit, and Y, which is a Greek and not a Latin character, and only serves Greek words, follows the nature of their language.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, do not ignore Hebrew letters, which according to all wise men are the most effective. They have the greatest likeness with the celestials and the world. The letters of other languages are not so effective, because they are more distant from them: surely the following table will explain their dispositions.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Also, each letter has double numbers in their order—that is, extended—whereby how many letters according to their order are simply
    expressed, and then collected, which then are gathered with all the preceding
    letters and their numbers. Then they also have integral numbers, which result from the names of the letters according to the various ways of numbering them.#t_footnote(1146)[13]
