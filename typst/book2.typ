    Chapter 1. Of the necessity of the discipline of mathematics and its many wonderful operations, which only the arts of mathematics can perform.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The disciplines of mathematics and the like are so necessary for magic that it is professed that without them, everyone will lose their way. Their work will be frustrated and they will achieve few desired effects.#t_footnote(1148)[1] Indeed, whatever exists and is possible in these more inferiors, natural virtues happen and are ruled by “number, weight, and measure.”#t_footnote(1149)[2] Harmony, motion, light, and all things that we see in these inferiors have their root and foundation in them.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Yet, even without natural virtues, operations can be produced that are similar to nature from only the discipline of mathematics—as Plato said, things not true and participating with the divine, but with a certain likeness to those things related to them. Some examples are bodies that can move or speak but exist without animal virtues:#t_footnote(1150)[3] such things were made by the ancients—for instance, the statues and αὐτóματα#t_footnote(1151)[4] of Daedalus. As Aristotle recalled, the tripods of Vulcan and Daedalus moved by themselves and entered into contest by their own volition, as narrated by Homer.#t_footnote(1152)[5] We also read of the feast of Hiarba the Gymnosophist,#t_footnote(1153)[6] whose golden statues moved by themselves and worked as cupbearers and carvers for the guests.#t_footnote(1154)[7] We also read of the statues of Mercury that spoke#t_footnote(1155)[8] and the wooden pigeon of Architas that flew.#t_footnote(1156)[9] Cassiodorus wrote of the wonders of Boethius, a Diomedes in bronze that blew a trumpet, a bronze snake that hissed, and imitation birds that sang sweet songs.#t_footnote(1157)[10]

    #emph[Of the wonderful arts of mirrors.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Of this kind are various wonders that are produced in images from geometry and optics, of which we made mention earlier when we spoke of the element air. Thus, mirrors are made—some concave, others cylindrical—that make the likeness of things in air, remote and outside of their space, that seem like shadows. Apollonius and Vitellius#t_footnote(1158)[11] taught of these in their books on perspective and mirrors. We read that Pompey the Great brought a certain mirror among the spoils to Rome from the east, in which armies of soldiers could be seen.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Certain transparent mirrors are made, which are dyed with the juices of certain specific herbs, that shine with an artificial light. The entire air around is filled with wonderful phantoms. I have learned how to make two reciprocal mirrors in which, with the shining Sun, everything that is illuminated by those rays can be seen clearly many miles away.

    Hence, a magician who is an expert in natural philosophy and mathematics,#t_footnote(1159)[12] and who understands the middle sciences arising from each of these—namely, arithmetic, music, geometry, optics, astronomy and which weights, measures, and proportions are limbs and joints of science—should also recognize the mechanical arts coming from those. Why should it seem wonderful if he surpasses over other men and their talents in those arts, working many wonders that prudent and knowledgeable men greatly admire? Surely today are there not visible traces of ancient works—for example, the columns of Hercules and Alexander,#t_footnote(1160)[13] the Caspian Gates melted from bronze and bolted with iron beams so that no talent or art can destroy? There is also the pyramid of Julius Caesar near the Vatican,#t_footnote(1161)[14] mountains built in the middle of the sea, and mounds and masses of stones, of which I have seen myself in Britannia collected together by a scarcely credible art. And we read from faithful histories of similar skills, by which cliffs were once torn, valleys completed, mountains leveled, rocks pierced, promontories in the sea opened, the bowels of the earth excavated, rivers redirected. By such skills, seas were once restrained and connected with other seas, and their depths were explored. Lakes and swamps were dried, new islands made, and other islands restored to the mainland.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    All of which, although they seem to be in conflict with nature, are confirmed both by what we read [in those faithful histories] and by vestiges that may still be discerned to this day. The vulgar say these are works of daemons, since the arts and skills [by which such things are accomplished] have died out from memory, nor do those who attempt to explore them understand them. Therefore, some who see a miracle being shown (being blind to understanding) dismiss all effects or wonders to daemons when such things are [actually] operations of either natural or mathematic disciplines. One can be ignorant of the virtue of magnets and see heavy iron brought up or suspended in air. We read of just such a situation: in the past, the iron idol of Mercury at Triers#t_footnote(1162)[15] was suspended in the middle of the temple by lodestone. This verse confirms it:
  ]
  #p_img[
    #emph[The iron staff-bearer flies in the mid-air.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    We also read something similar to this of the idol of the Sun in the temple of Serapis in Egypt—surely would we immediately declare that this is the work of daemons?#t_footnote(1163)[16] However, if one understands the virtues of magnets toward iron and tests them, they will entirely cease to wonder about it and will no longer doubt that it is a work of nature.

  #p_normal[
    Thus, it is appropriate that you know that as we collect natural virtues through natural things, we can thus receive celestial virtues through abstract, mathematical, and celestial things—such as motion, life, perception, speech, prophecy, and divination. Also, less disposed matter, as it is less natural, is made only by art; therefore, it is said that images are made to speak and predict the future. William of Auvergne wrote of a bronze head kindled while Saturn was rising, which spoke with a human voice.#t_footnote(1164)[17]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, one who chooses a recognized disposed material, and allows the most prepared and strongest agent, will produce undoubted and more powerful effects. Indeed, it is a general opinion of Pythagoreans that mathematics—being more of a form#t_footnote(1165)[18] than physical—are more active and depend less on [matter] in their operations. Numbers, among all the aspects of mathematics as they are more of a form, are thus also more active. That this has such a virtue and effectiveness to good and evil is not only granted by pagan philosophers but also by Hebrew and Christian theologians.#t_footnote(1166)[19]

    Chapter 2. Of numbers, their power, and virtue.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Severinus Boethius said: “All things that are made from primeval nature seem to be formed by the method of numbers; indeed, this is the principal exemplar in the mind of the Creator. The multitude of elements, the turning of time, the movement of the stars, the rotation of the sky, and the position of all things are borrowed from and bound in numbers.”#t_footnote(1167)[1] Therefore, numbers are powerful and have great and sublime virtues. Indeed, we should not wonder at this: numbers are in so many natural things and have such great hidden virtues [demonstrated] through manifest works.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed, numbers in and of themselves are much greater, more hidden, more wonderful, and more effective, inasmuch as they are more of a form and more perfect. They are engrafted in the heavens, mixed in separate substances, and finally have the greatest and simplest mixture of Ideas in the divine mind, from which they obtain their own and most effective strengths. Also because of this, they can attain much and many more powers from daemonic and divine gifts, because in natural things elemental qualities are stronger and more capable of changing some elemental thing.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Again, everything that exists and subsists is obtained by the virtues of certain numbers. Indeed, time depends on numbers, and all movements and action, and all that is subject to time and movement. Also, singing, voices, and their harmonious proportion have their power and proportion through numbers. They arise from numbers, and through lines and points they establish characters and figures. These are proper to magical operations, the medium being taken between each of them by declining to the limits, such as is used in letters.

  #p_quote[
    #emph[Everything depends on certain numbers.]

  #p_normal[
    Finally, all natural species and those that are above nature are bound by certain numbers, which Pythagoras considered, saying that everything depends on numbers, distributing each virtue to each thing.#t_footnote(1168)[2] And Proclus said: “Number always exists, yet one is in voice, another is in the proportion of things, another in the soul and reason, and another in the divine.” Themistius, Boethius, and Averroes the Babylonian, together with Plato, thus extolled numbers, as no one can be a correctthinking philosopher without them.#t_footnote(1169)[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But they speak of rational formalized numbers, not of the material, sensible, or vocal numbers of merchants,#t_footnote(1170)[4] of which the Pythagoreans, the Platonic Academy, and our Augustine make no regard. They turned their attention to the proportion resulting from them, which are called natural and formalized and rational numbers, from which great sacraments arise in such an extent in nature, as well as the divine and celestial.#t_footnote(1171)[5] Through them is a way to investigate and understand all that is knowable, and through them is a close access to natural prophecies. The abbot Joachim himself proceeded in no other way in his prophecies than though formalized numbers.#t_footnote(1172)[6]

    In numbers therefore lie such a wonderful efficacy and virtue for good as well as for evil, which not only do the most splendid philosophers teach but Catholic teachers do as well; the chief among others, Saint Jerome, Augustine, Origen, Ambrose, Gregory of Nazianzus, Athanasius, Basil, Hilary, Rabanus,#t_footnote(1174)[2] Bede, and many others confirm. Hence, Hilary in #emph[Commentaries on the Psalms] testified that the seventy elders arranged the order of the Psalms according to the efficacy of numbers;#t_footnote(1175)[3] likewise, Rabanus, the famous teacher, composed a book on the singular virtues of numbers.#t_footnote(1176)[4]

    Now of other such great virtues numbers possess in nature is shown in the herb pentaphyllon, which is [also called] cinquefoil. Indeed, it is said from the virtue of five, it resists poison, drives away daemons, is conducive to atonement, and its leaf, if one is taken twice a day in wine, cures a quotidian#t_footnote(1177)[5] fever, three for tertian, and four for quartan.#t_footnote(1178)[6] Similarly, four grains of the heliotrope#t_footnote(1179)[7] seed cures quartan; however, it is said that three is useful for tertian. In a similar way, it is said that vervain in wine cures fever, if in tertian cut from the third joint, if in quartan into the fourth joint. Serpents will die if pierced by an arrow once, but if twice they will strengthen.#t_footnote(1180)[8] These and many more of the like are gathered and testified by various authorities, and wherever they occur we can be sure that the cause is in the various proportions of various numbers with each other.

    Natural number is not considered here, but the formalized reasoning that is in number, and that what we said before should always be held in the mind, not those virtues in voice or the numbers of merchants, but in the rational, formalized, and natural that is distinguished and held by God and the sacraments of nature. But whoever learns to join vocal and natural numbers with the divine and mix them proportionally into the same harmony will be able to work and recognize wonders through these numbers. Also, Pythagoreans profess that they can predict much through the numbers of names, in which surely if there wasn’t some great mystery, John would not have said in Revelation: “He who understands, let him calculate the number of the name of the beast, which is the number of man”; and the Hebrews and kabbalists are most famous for this manner of computation,#t_footnote(1181)[9] as is shown below.

  #p_normal[
    But you must know that simple numbers signify divine things, tens the heavens, hundreds the terrestrial, and thousands the future of the world.#t_footnote(1182)[10] Additionally, the parts of the mind are according to an arithmetical moderateness by means of the identity or how they are connected with each other by an equality of excessiveness, but the body, whose parts differ in magnitude, is according to the moderateness of the geometry composing them, but animals are from both—namely, the soul and body—according to the harmony agreeing with the moderateness; hence, numbers work greatly in the soul, the figure of the body, and the harmony of the animal.

    Now we will define the individual numbers themselves. However, because number is nothing other than unity repeated, we will first consider one itself. Indeed, one most simply penetrates all numbers and is the common measure of all numbers. The source and origin contains all numbers in itself, especially those that are joined, and is the fate of every multitude and is always the same and unchangeable. Also, when multiplied from itself, it produces nothing besides itself. It is indivisible and free from any parts: but if at some time it is divided, it is not cut but multiplied—namely into ones; yet none of these ones are greater or lesser than the whole one, as if the part is smaller than the whole. Thus, it is multiplied not into parts but by itself.#t_footnote(1183)[1]

    Therefore, some call it Concord, others Piety, and others Friendship because they tie, as they are not cut into parts. But Martianus [Capella], from the opinion of Aristotle, asserted that its name is Cupid because it is only one, always searches for itself, always wishes, and has nothing beyond itself, but is entirely free from exaltation or ties, turning its own ardor to itself.#t_footnote(1184)[2]

One is the beginning of all, everything is always one, nothing is beyond it, and all that exists desires one,#t_footnote(1185)[3] because everything proceeds from one. As they are the same, everything necessarily shares from that one: and as everything proceeds from one into many, thus all attempt to return to that one from which they came, and it is necessary to lay aside the multitude.#t_footnote(1186)[4]

    Two is the first number because it is the first multitude. It cannot be measured by any number except by one, which is the common measure of all numbers. It is not composed of numbers but from only one unity and one coordination; nor is it said to be an uncomposed number but, more properly, “not composed”; but three is the first number that is called uncomposed.#t_footnote(1192)[1] Two is the first sprout and offspring of one: hence it is called birth, Juno, a conjectural embodiment, the proven first motion, the first form of parity, the first number of equality, the extreme, an interval, and therefore personal justice and those individual actions because two are gladly equally weighed.#t_footnote(1193)[2] It is called the number of science, memory, light, and the number of man, who is said to be another lesser world.

    It is called the number of charity, mutual love, marriage, and fellowship, as it is said by the Lord: “The two is of one flesh”; and in Ecclesiastes: “Two together is better than one; indeed because they have the benefit of each other’s company. If one falls, the other supports them. Woe to the lonely, because when they fall, they will have no support. And if two sleep together, they will have mutual warmth; how then will only one become warm? And if some prevail against one, two may resist them.”#t_footnote(1194)[3] And it is called the number of marriage and sex; indeed, because there are two sexes, masculine and feminine, and pigeons bear two eggs, from which a male is hatched from one, and the second female.#t_footnote(1195)[4] And it is called the capable center, sharing in good and evil, the beginning of division, multitude, and distinction, and signifies matter.#t_footnote(1196)[5]

Hence this is also why God appointed all unclean animals to enter the ark in pairs#t_footnote(1197)[6] because two (as I have said) is the number of foulness and unfortunate auspices, especially if those things taken from auspices are Saturnine or Martial: for these two are considered unfortunate by astrologers.

    Pythagoreans call the number four tetractys and prefer it to all virtues of [other] numbers#t_footnote(1227)[1] because it is the foundation and root of all other numbers; from which it is the foundation of everything that is squared, whether artificial, natural, or divine, as we will show below. It signifies solidity, which is demonstrated by the figure of a square.#t_footnote(1228)[2] Indeed, four is the first squared plane that depends on two proportions, of which the first is one to two, then two to four. And it is produced from a double procession and proportion, namely one to one and two to two, beginning from one, ending in four: whose proportions differ in this because according to arithmetic, they are unequal to each other, but according to geometry they are equal.

    Therefore, four is appointed to God the Father and in fact contains the mystery of the whole Trinity: for its simple proportion—namely, first one to one—one signifying the Father’s substance, from which one equal Son proceeds. But the other procession, also simple—namely, two to two—the Holy Spirit is observed as the second procession from each, as thus the Son is equal to the Father in the first procession, the Holy Spirit is equal to both in the second procession.

    From four is the source and head of all divinity. The Pythagoreans called this the perpetual fountain of nature. Indeed, there are four degrees in the scale of nature—namely, being, life, perception, and intelligence. There are four natures in motion—namely, ascending, descending, advancing, and encircling. There are four points in the heavens—namely, rising, setting, mid-heaven, and the lower heaven.#t_footnote(1229)[3] There are four elements under the heavens—namely, fire, air, water, and earth. According to these are the four triplicities in the heavens, and four first qualities under the heavens—namely, cold, heat, dryness, and moistness. From these are the four humors: blood, phlegm, choler, and melancholy. Likewise, the year is divided into four parts, which are spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Similarly, the wind is divided into Eurus, Zephyrus, Auster, and Boreas.#t_footnote(1230)[4] Likewise, there are four rivers in Paradise and as many infernal.

    Additionally, four completes all knowledge; first, it satisfies the progression of all simple numbers with four limits—namely, one, two, three and four, which constitute ten. It fills the difference in all numbers, containing the first even and the first uneven in it. In music, it has a fourth, the grace of the fourth voice. Likewise, the Pythagorean tetrachord and scale, in which is the found the first musical singing, and contains all musical harmonies: for doubles, triples, quadruples, one and a half, four thirds, octaves, double octaves, fifths, fourths, and all harmony is kept in the limits of four.

    Also, the entirety of mathematics is contained in the limits of four—namely, point, line, plane, and depth.

There are also four limits contained in metaphysics—namely, being, essence, virtue, and action. Moral philosophy contains four virtueses#t_footnote(1231)[5]—namely, prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. It also has the power of justice; hence, the fourfold law, which is providence from God, fate from the World Soul, nature from the heavens, and prudence from man.

    The number five is not unimportant and is powerful. Indeed, it is made up of the first even and first odd number, from the feminine and masculine. Indeed, the odd number is male, but the even is female (from which mathematicians call one the father, and other the mother). Therefore, five is of no small perfection or virtue, because it is generated from the mixture of these numbers.#t_footnote(1244)[1] Additionally, it is the most lawful middle of the universal number—that is, ten. [This is because] on every side around five you can divide ten: hence if you take nine, one remains; if you take eight, two remains; taking seven then three, or six then four; each one totaled consists of ten. Five is always that perfect medium#t_footnote(1245)[2] and is equidistant.

    Therefore it is called the number of marriage by the Pythagoreans, and it is said to be justice because it is divided equally from ten.#t_footnote(1246)[3] There are five senses in man, sight, sound, smell, taste, touch; five powers in the soul, vegetative, sensitive, concupiscible, irascible, rational; there are five fingers in the hand; there are five wandering planets in the heavens,#t_footnote(1247)[4] according to which there are fivefold terms#t_footnote(1248)[5] in each of the signs; in the elements there are five kinds of mixtures—that is, stones, metals, plants, zoophytes, and animals—there are as many kinds of animals (for example, men, quadrupeds, reptiles, swimming things,#t_footnote(1249)[6] and flying things); and there are five kinds, from which God composed everything (namely, being, the same, the other, standing,#t_footnote(1250)[7] and moving).#t_footnote(1251)[8] Swallows do not bear unless it is with five chicks, which they feed with great equality, beginning with the eldest and then the rest according to their birth. Likewise, this number has great power in purifications: for in the sacred it drives away evil daemons, and in the natural, it drives away poisons. Likewise, it is said to be the number of happiness and gratitude, is the seal of the Holy Spirit, entwines all bindings, and is the number of the cross; likewise, it signifies Christ’s principal wounds, which were also glorified in his body to protect the worthy.#t_footnote(1252)[9] Gentile philosophers dedicated it as sacred to Mercury, and of a much more excellent power than four, as much as a living thing surpasses a non-living thing.#t_footnote(1253)[10]

    Six is the number of perfection because it is the most perfect nature. In the continuity of all numbers from one to ten, it alone is perfect, because collecting the parts of itself results in the same, not lacking any deficiency, or abounding in surplus. For, if its parts are collected—namely, the middle, third, and sixth, which are three, two, and one—the entire body of six is perfectly filled. Indeed, that perfection is missing from other numbers.

    Hence Pythagoreans asserted that it was absolutely suited for generation and marriage and called it the seal#t_footnote(1258)[1] of the world. Indeed, the world consists of the number six, neither with an unlimited abundant surplus and is not frustrated or needing necessities. This is because God perfected and completed the world in six days; indeed, on the sixth day “God saw what he had made, and it was very good; therefore, the heavens and earth and all adorning them were completed.”#t_footnote(1259)[2]

For six days the glory of the Lord inclined over Mount Sinai, covering it with a cloud.#t_footnote(1261)[4] Cherubim have six wings.

There are six different positions, up, down, front, behind, right, and left. There are six natural duties, without which nothing can exist—namely, is size, color, figure, interval, standing, and motion. A solid figure of a square has six surfaces.

    The number seven has various and manifold powers. Indeed, it consists of one and six, or two and five, or three and four, and it has a unity as if it were tying twin threes.

    Pythagoreans call it the vehicle of human life because it does not borrow from its parts, as it perfects from the totality of its own law. Indeed, it contains the body and soul: for the body consists of the four elements and is affected by the four qualities. Three likewise considers the soul according to its threefold power—namely, rationality, irasciblity, and desire.#t_footnote(1265)[2]

    Therefore, seven (because it contains three and four) connects the soul and body. Likewise, the power of this number pertains to the generation of men: it conceives, forms, feeds, nourishes, enlivens, and altogether makes man exist. For instance, when the womb of a woman receives the reproductive seed, if it remains for seven hours without shedding, it will stay and life is certain. Then, after the first seven days, it coagulates and is made suitable for receiving a human figure. It then produces matured infants, which is called a #emph[septimestres], [which means] born in the seventh month. Then, after birth, a newly born infant is distinguished in the seventh hour; indeed, beyond this number, the child should be able to breathe air and support life. After seven days, it throws away the remains of the umbilical cord. After two times seven, it begins to see moving light. In the third seventh, it freely moves its eyes and entire face. After seven months, it begins teething. After the second seventh month, it sits without fear of falling. After the third seventh, sounds rush forth into words. After the fourth seventh, it stands firmly and walks. After the fifth seventh month, it begins to dread breastfeeding. After seven years, the first teeth fall and others more suitable for solid food emerge, and integral speaking comes. After the second seventh year, boys start puberty and a generation is born. For the third seventh year, he emerges a tall man showing his youthful prime, grows a beard, and becomes strong and is able to generate. All the way to the fourth seventh, man begins to grow wider and stops growing taller. In the fifth, all power and strength has completely increased. However, in the sixth seventh year, they keep their strength. With the seventh seventh, prudence is consummated and arrives at the perfect age of man. After reaching the tenth seventh year, where the number seven brings together completion, he then reaches the common limit for life, as the Prophet said: “The days of our years are seventy years.”#t_footnote(1266)[3]

    Also, the highest measure of the height of the human body is seven feet.#t_footnote(1267)[4] Likewise, there are seven degrees in the body that complete the measurement of height from the bottom to the top—namely, the marrow, bones, nerves, veins, arteries, flesh, and skin. There are seven which the Greeks called “black members”—namely, the tongue, heart, lungs, liver, and two kidneys. There are seven principal parts of the body, the head, chest, hands, feet, and genitals. Likewise, breath and food depend on it because without drinking and breathing beyond seven hours, life does not endure.#t_footnote(1268)[5] Furthermore, if [a living being is] placed in continued hunger, they will not live after seven days.

    Likewise, the Moon is the seventh of the planets and closest to us, watching this number before the rest, and moving and dispensing the light of that number: for in twenty-eight days it circuits around the entire zodiac, with which number of days seven with seven is its limit—namely, from one all the way to seven, with as many numbers added to their preceding, making, filling, and accomplishing four times seven days,#t_footnote(1278)[15] in which the Moon circuits and wanders through the entire latitude and longitude of the zodiac by measuring and going over it again. Similarly, it dispenses its light with a perpetual varying law in seven days; indeed, the first seven to the middle are, as it were, an increasing divided orb. The second seven is a complete orb of light. The third decreases again drawing a divided orb. The last, the fourth seventh, its light is diminished to renew again. And by the same seven it disposes the increase and decrease of the sea: for the first seven from the initial increase of the Moon [the sea] decreases a little; for the second it gradually increases; for the third seven it is similar to the first, and for the fourth it is like the second.#t_footnote(1279)[16] It also applies to Saturn, which is the seventh planet, and arises from the lower.

    It is the number of repentance and forgiveness, hence setting up seven years of penance for some sin according to the opinion of the Wise Man saying: “And sevenfold over the sinner.” Likewise, the seventh year is made for forgiveness and after seven squared satisfies the forgiveness, as we read in Leviticus. Christ consummated his oration of our atonement with seven petitions, and hence it is called the number of freedom because Hebrew slaves claimed liberty for themselves on the seventh year. It is most suited for divine praises; of which the Prophet said: “I say praises to you over your righteous judgments seven times a day.” It is also the number of revenge, as the scriptures say: “From Cain is given a sevenfold revenge”; and in Psalms, it says: “Return sevenfold to our neighbors into their bosoms.” Hence, we read in the Gospels that Solomon took seven abominations and seven more wicked spirits. It also signifies the time of the present circle, which completes the circle of seven days. And it is sacred to the Holy Spirit, which the prophet Isaiah described His gifts are sevenfold—that is, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of deliberation and strength, the spirit of knowledge and piety, and the spirit of fear of the Lord, and as we read in Zachariah, the seven eyes of God.#t_footnote(1291)[28] Likewise, there are seven angels, spirits standing before the face of God, as we read in Tobias;#t_footnote(1292)[29] and in Revelation there were seven burning torches before the throne of God,#t_footnote(1293)[30] and seven golden candlesticks, and in the middle of them was one like the Son of Man, and He held the seven stars in his right hand.

    From all that was said above, it is evident that seven among other numbers is deservedly said to be most full of efficacy.

    Pythagoreans called eight the number of justice and fullness. It [was called] the first (justice), because it is the first of all numbers to be divided into equal parts—that is, in four. It is likewise connected for the same reason by being divided by two twos: twice two times two, and because of this division it assumed the name justice for itself. However, the other name of “fullness” is taken because of a connection with corporeal solidity, because it is the first to make a solid body.#t_footnote(1409)[1]

Indeed, these muses are suited to the nine spheres; thus, the first refers to the supreme sphere, which is called the Prime Mover, and thus descends by degree according to the written order all the way to the last, which refers to the sphere of the Moon. Thus, Calliope is applied to the #emph[Primum Mobile,] Urania to the starry heaven, Polyhymnia to Saturn, Terpsichore to Jupiter, Clio to Mars, Melpomene to the Sun, Erato to Venus, Euterpe to Mercury, and Thalia to the Moon.

    This number, as with one, is also circular, because adding it together returns to one from where it has its beginning, is the limit of all numbers, and completes and begins tens. As ten flows back to one from where it comes, thus everything that is flowing returns back to the beginning of its emanation. Thus, water runs to the sea from which it originally drew, bodies are taken from the earth and return, time returns to eternity from which it flows, and mind is made by God and returns to Him. Finally, all creatures flow into nothing, from which they are created—unless it is from the divine word, in which all is hidden. Everything with ten or through ten makes a circle, as Proclus said, beginning from God and ending with him. Likewise, God is the first unity, before he communicated himself to the inferiors, first diffusing himself into the first numbers—namely, three—afterward into ten, as it were, into ten ideas and making measures of all numbers and all things, which the Hebrews called ten attributes and count ten divine names—from which cause there is no further number. Hence all tens have a certain divinity in them and, in the Law, they are taken as God’s own together with first-fruits. [They are] as primordial things, the beginning of numbers, and each ten is a limit as it were, returning to the beginning and end of everything.#t_footnote(1441)[15]

    I have often read in books on magic and its operations and experiments of certain wonderful (and such as they seemed to me ridiculous) gestures. I thought that they were certain occult pacts with daemons, and because of this I rejected and abandoned them. However, after examining these things deeply, I began to understand that these magical gestures are not daemonic pacts but instead the rationale of numbers is hidden in them. The ancients represented numbers through various bending backward and forward of the hands and fingers. With these gestures, magicians designated indescribable virtues unknown to sound. They joined various numbers and, with alternating fingers, silently proclaimed and adored the sacred gods that rule over the world.

    Capella also remembers those rites, saying of Arithmetic:#t_footnote(1516)[1] “However the fingers of the virgin kept recoiling and quickly moved in incomprehensible, wormy, bubbling springs, who saluted Jupiter by quickly entering 717 numbers with her bent finger. Then Philosophy, as she stood near Triton, asked why Arithmetic began with such number; to which Pallas said, they greeted Jupiter with his own name.”#t_footnote(1517)[2]

    So that this can be better understood, if you please, we will join with the tradition of Bede, who therefore said: “When you say ‘1’ bend the smallest finger and place it in the middle of the palm. When you say ‘2’ bend the next finger and place it next to the smallest. When you say ‘3’ bend the third finger in a similar manner. When you say ‘4’ likewise raise the smallest finger. When you say ‘5’ likewise raise the next finger from the smallest. When you say ‘6,’ the third is likewise raised, with only that which is called the ring finger being fixed in the middle of the palm. When you say ‘7,’ place only the smallest finger above the base of the palm, with the others meanwhile raised; just as when you say ‘8’ with the ring finger. When you say ‘9,’ place the middle with them. When you say ‘10,’ put the nail of the forefinger in the middle joint of the thumb. When you say ‘20,’ place the top of the middle finger between the joints of the thumb and forefinger. When saying ‘30,’ clasp the nail of the forefinger and thumb gently together. When you say ‘40,’ bring the inside of the thumb to the outside of the forefinger, with only those two raised. When you say ‘50,’ bend the thumb with the outer joint curved like the Greek letter gamma, inclined toward the palm. When you say ‘60,’ with the thumb as above, carefully curve the forefinger to encircle the thumb from the front. When you say ‘70,’ make the forefinger turned as before and make the thumb stretched long, with only the nail raised past the middle joint of the forefinger. When you say ‘80,’ with the forefinger turned as before and the thumb extended at length—that is, the nail fixed on the middle joint of the forefinger. When you say ‘90,’ place the nail of the forefinger at the base of the erect thumb. Thus far, all of these are with the left hand.

    The marks of numbers are depicted in different ways by various nations; the Romans formed these by the following marks. Valerius Probus described the letters of the ancients, which are hitherto in use today, these being:#t_footnote(1520)[1]

    There are other marks of numbers arithmeticians and calculators commonly use today, which according to the order of numbers, the figures are depicted: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9., to which is added a circular mark signifying removal; of course, this figure is 0, which although it does not signify a number, it makes the others signify tens, hundreds, or thousands, as is well known by arithmeticians.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    There are also marks that show ten by a small stick that has a line across it; but fives by placing a line touching it, but not dividing it; but ones by placing a separate [line], which you can see in this example:

hundreds, such as 00 or II#super[o] is two hundred, 000 or III#super[o] is three hundred,

  #p_normal[
    For numerical marks, the Greeks use alphabetical letters in three [different] ways. The first is a singular element according to the alphabetic series signifying the numbers for their place; for the place of the alphabetic order obtained by each letter, it represents the same number, as you can see here: #t_img("./images/00039.jpeg")
  ]
  #p_normal[
    This is the first order of the numbers of the Greeks.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    In the second [way], the Greeks divided the entire alphabet into three classes. The first begins with alpha as one; the second, beginning with iota, is ten; and the third, beginning with rho, is hundred#t_footnote(1521)[1]—and the Greeks followed this order from the Hebrews, whom they imitated. However, because their alphabet is crippled by that rule, it is necessary to add three more figures and letters, which of course are explained in the numbers 6, 90 and 900,#t_footnote(1522)[2] which is clear in the following:#t_footnote(1523)[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    #t_img("./images/00040.jpeg")
  ]
  #p_normal[
    If to any of these letters is under-signed a tone of a small sharp stick, it signifies as many thousands, as in this example:#t_footnote(1524)[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    #t_img("./images/00041.jpeg")
  ]
  #p_normal[
    In the third way, the Greeks use only six letters to designate their numbers—namely, I for 1, Π for 5, because it is the start of the word πέντε,#t_footnote(1525)[5] which is 5, Δ for 10 from δέκα,#t_footnote(1526)[6] H for 100 from ἑκατόν,#t_footnote(1527)[7] X for 1,000 from the word χίλια,#t_footnote(1528)[8] and M for 10,000 from μύρια.#t_footnote(1529)[9] From these six letters are joined, according to this method, to four or to other numbers, forming the rest, in addition to Π, which is not multiplied or joined but always signifies the fives of others, as is shown in the following example: #t_img("./images/00042.jpeg")

    The Hebrews also have letters marking numbers but are far more excellent than any other language, since the greatest mysteries lie hidden in Hebrew numbers, as is handled in that part of kabbalah that is called #emph[Notaricon]. There are 22 principal Hebrew letters, of which 5 have other different figures appointed at the end of speech, which are therefore called the five finals. These are added [to the other letters] making 27. [The letters] then share in three degrees: the first refers to ones, the second to tens, and the third degree signifies hundreds. Any of these, if depicted in large characters, signifies as many thousands, as thus: #t_img("./images/00043.jpeg")

  #p_normal[
    These are the classes of Hebrew numbers:#t_footnote(1530)[1]

  #p_normal[
    And from these simple figures, by combining and composing them, describe all remaining composed numbers, such as 11, 12, 110, and 111, by adding ones to tens. [Compose] the rest in a similar way. Yet the number 15 is not written by 10 and 5, but by 9 and 6—namely, 
#t_img("./images/00046.jpeg"), out of respect of the divine name 
#t_img("./images/00047.jpeg"), which makes 15, so that the sacred name is not wasted on the profane.

    And the Egyptians, Ethiopians, Chaldeans, and Arabs have their numerical marks, which most often occur among magical characters: therefore, one may wish to learn these before being skilled in these letters. The Chaldeans signify numbers with the letters of their alphabet according to the custom of the Hebrews. That alphabet is recorded at the end of the first book.#t_footnote(1531)[2] Additionally, I have found in two most ancient astrological and magical books some most elegant marks of numbers, which I have also decided to note here, and they were in both volumes as such: #t_img("./images/00048.jpeg")

    As I have shown, the Greek and Hebrew alphabets are divided into three classes, in which numbers are assigned to single letters—the first group representing the ones, the second tens, and the third hundreds. To complete [a total of] twenty-seven characters in the Roman alphabet, they lacked four. Those places were supplied by the simple consonants “i” and “u,” as in the names Iohannes and Valentinianus. Then the aspirant consonants “hi” and “hu,” as in Hieronymus and Huilhelmus, although the Germans use “hu” for the double aspirant “w,” but the Italians and French in their vulgar [speech] put in that place “g” and “u” joined, thus is written: “Vuilhelmus” and “Guilhelmus.”

    But now if you wish to know the ruling star of some birth, compute their name and each parent’s name by single letters according to the numbers written above and collect the entire sum and divide by 9, subtracting from that as often as you can.

This account is shown elsewhere. By a similar rationale, if one wishes to know some horoscope,#t_footnote(1538)[6] compute their name and the name of the mother and father and collect the entire total and divide by 12. If the remainder is 1 it denotes Leo; if Juno 2 then Aquarius, if Vestal 3 then Capricorn, if 4 then Sagittarius, if 5 Cancer, if Venusian 6 Taurus, if Palladian 7 Aries, if Vulcan 8 Libra, if Martial 9 Scorpio, if 10 Virgo, if 11 Pisces, if Phoeban 12 it represents Gemini; and this is also accounted elsewhere.

    But no one should wonder that numbers through names can foretell many things since Pythagorean philosophers and Hebrew kabbalists testify that in these numbers lie some occult mysteries that are understood by few. Indeed, the Most High created all “numbers, measures, and weights,”#t_footnote(1539)[7] from which the truth of letters and names had its birth, whose method was not built accidentally but certainly (although unknown to us). Hence John in Revelation said: “He who has understanding, compute the number of the name of the beast, which is the number of man.”#t_footnote(1540)[8] These are not of those names, which are imposed by the dissonant dissimilarlity of nations and the rites of diverse people according to the causes and cultures of the places of men, but those which are inspired into each at its birth by the heavens and joining of the stars, which the Hebrew mekubalim and Egyptian wise men once taught to elicit from each birth.

    The sixth table is Mercury, which results in 8 led into itself, containing 64 numbers, of which there are 8 in any direction, and in each diameter, making 2,080. Presiding over them are divine names with an intelligence for good and a daemon for evil and elicited from them are characters for Mercury and its spirits. If Mercury is made fortunate, carve in silver, tin, or yellow brass, or inscribed on virgin parchment, it makes the wearer pleasing, and fortunate for whatever they wish to obtain. It confers gain and chases away poverty. It confers memory, intellect, divination, and noticing occult things by dreams. If Mercury is unfortunate, it makes the opposite to all of the above.

    The seventh table is the Moon. It contains 9 multiplied by itself, having 81 numbers, in which there are 9 on any side and diameter, producing 369, and the entire sum is 3,321. Presiding over them are divine names with an intelligence for good and a daemon for evil and elicited from them are characters of the Moon and its spirits. When the Moon is fortunate and carved in silver, it makes the wearer pleasing, amiable, delightful, eager, honorable, and wards away all wickedness and ill will. It excels in security in journeys, makes wealth and a healthy body, and drives away enemies and other harmful things from whatever place they wish. If the Moon is unfortunate, [carved] in lead, and buried in some place, it makes that place—as well asits inhabitants, visitors, ships, springs, rivers, and mills—unfortunate. It makes all men against whom it was duly made unfortunate, making them flee from their land and country and from the place of their home wherever [the image] is buried. It hinders physicians, orators, and men in whichever office it is made against. But the way these seals and characters is elicited from the stars and the spirits. The acute investigator will easily be able to understand this from verifying these tables.

    Chapter 23. Of geometric figures and bodies, of what magical virtue they exert their influence, and which [figures] agree to each element and the heavens.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Geometric figures arising from numbers are thought to be no less powerful. From these, the circle especially responds to one and ten, for one is the center and circumference of all things. When [the digits of the number ten are] added, the numerical symbolism returns to one, from whence it began—the end and completion of all numbers.#t_footnote(1566)[1] The circle is said to be an infinite line, which has neither an end to or from it. Its beginning and end are at any point. From this, the circular motion is said to be infinite—indeed, not [infinite by] time but by place.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[The circle is the most perfect figure.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Hence, the circular figure is the greatest and most powerful of all and is believed to be most suitable for bindings and exorcisms. [It is the figure] from where [magicians] often fortify themselves to adjure evil daemons. The pentagon,#t_footnote(1567)[2] with the wonderful virtue of the number five, has command over evil daemons: by its line, it has five obtuse angles within itself; outside, the five are five acute triangle hexagons.#t_footnote(1568)[3] [These triangle hexagons] surround the interior pentagon, which holds great mysteries in itself. This must also be examined and understood from the other figures—the triangle, quadrangle, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, and the rest. They are constituted of multiple and different intersections, and they obtain different significations and virtues according to the diverse manner of drawing and proportion of lines and their number.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[The figure of the cross is powerful.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But the Egyptians and the Arabs confirmed that the figure of the cross has the highest power of all celestial powers, and is the firmest receptacle of the intelligences, because it is the most right figure of all, it contains four right angles, and is the first delineation of all surfaces, having length and width. They say it unites with celestial fortitude because that fortitude results from the uprightness and rays of the angles.#t_footnote(1569)[4] The stars are especially powerful when they hold the four angles in a celestial figure, and their rays extend to each other making a cross. Additionally (as we have shown above), [the cross] has a great harmony with the most powerful numbers—five, seven, and nine. The Egyptians and priests from the beginning of religion among sacred letters referred to it, allegorically signifying the life of future health. It was also impressed on the breast of Serapis, and the Greeks had a great veneration of it#t_footnote(1570)[5]—however, this belongs in [the section] about religion, which we will discuss elsewhere.

  #p_normal[
    One must pay attention to whatever wonderful operations are in figures. When we inscribe [figures] on paper, vellum, or on images, they do not act unless by the virtue that more sublime figures acquire by a certain love which comes from a natural aptitude or a similar agreement, inasmuch as they are precisely configured to these. It is just as when an echo is caused on the opposite wall, or when a concave mirror collects the rays of the Sun, which afterward reflect on the opposite body—which immediately burns, whether wood or other combustible. [We may compare how] a cithara causes reverberations in other citharas: [this will not happen] unless the similar figure is placed in view of its like. [It is like how when] two equally spaced strings on a lyre are plucked with the same proportionate tension one will suddenly shudder as the other vibrates.

  #p_quote[
    #emph[The figures of the elements and heaven.]

  #p_normal[
    Likewise, the figures and characters of which we have spoken conceive whatever virtues from the celestial figure inasmuch as they are impressed on suitable things that [the celestials] rule, or inasmuch as they are made at the right time when a figure [is] conspiring and expressing toward its like figure.#t_footnote(1571)[6] As these virtues are said to be from figures, thus they are also understood to be from geometrical bodies, which are the sphere, tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, and the like.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    One should not disregard the figures that Pythagoras and his followers—Timaeus, Locrus, and Plato—assigned to the elements and celestials: for instance, earth is the cube, 8 solid angles, and 24 planes and 6 sides, squared in the form of a die; but fire is a pyramid with 4 triangular sides and as many solid angles and 12 planes; but to air is placed an octahedron, out of 8 triangular sides and 6 solid angles and 24 planes; finally to water is signified an icosahedron, 20 sides, and 12 solid angles; but dedicated to the heaven is the dodecahedron, having 12 pentagonal sides and 20 solid angles, but 60 planes.#t_footnote(1572)[7]

    Chapter 24. Of musical harmony, and its strength and power.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Musical harmony is not void of gifts from the stars. Indeed, it is the most powerful imitator#t_footnote(1574)[1] of everything. Since it appropriately follows celestial bodies, it wonderfully provokes celestial influences and affects all listeners, [shaping their] intentions, gestures, movements, and actions. Customs are changed, and their qualities are suddenly provoked.#t_footnote(1575)[2] [They are moved] to joy or lamentation, towards boldness or tranquillity, and the like. Beasts, serpents, birds, and dolphins are provoked when hearing melodies. Thus, pipes allure birds and capture stags; fish are restrained in a lake in Alexandria by rattling; [musical] chords persuade friendship between dolphins and men; songs from a cithara induce Hyperborean swans; Indian elephants are charmed by the voices of organs.#t_footnote(1576)[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The elements themselves also delight in melodies.#t_footnote(1577)[4] The Halesian#t_footnote(1578)[5] fountain, otherwise tranquil and quiet, jumps up and rises over its banks when a flute is sounded.#t_footnote(1579)[6] In Lydia, there are what are called the isles of nymphs. From the singing of a flute, [the nymphs] immediately go to the middle of a lake and dance in a circular motion, afterward returning to the shore. M. Varro wrote that he saw this himself.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    There are some things more wonderful than these. For instance, on the Attica shore, in the sea there are sounds like a cithara. There are certain stones in Megaris that make [the sound of] a lyre with each strike.#t_footnote(1580)[7] Such is the great power of music. Indeed, it soothes the soul, stimulates the mind, incites warriors to battle, and soothes the labor and fatigue of every work. It calls back the lapsed and desperate and comforts travelers. Arabs say that camels carrying loads are comforted by their leader’s singing. In a similar way, those carrying heavy loads sing because it enables and lightens them.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Songs of praise.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed, songs enable and delight labors, soften anger, delight sadness and anxiety, pacify discord, temper raging madness, and dissipate false thinking. Hence, Democritus and Theophrastus affirmed that some sicknesses of the body and mind are thus either cured or caused; thus, we read that Terpander and Arion of Methymna cured sick people in Lesbos and Ionia, and Ismenias cured very many gravely ill Thebans by shaking them with singing. Additionally, Orpheus, Amphion, David, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Asclepiades, and Timotheus often caused certain wonders with singing and sounds. Indeed, when lethargic, familiar melodies excite the dull mind, and playful tones restrain madness and anger. Thus, David held back the fury of Saul with his cithara, Pythagoras called back the immoderate adolescent from lust, and Timotheus excited King Alexander into a frenzy and again held him back.#t_footnote(1581)[8]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Saxo Grammaticus wrote in #emph[Danish History] of a certain musician who had such a power that they could drag anyone into a frenzy of madness with sounds of little melodies, as none of the listeners’ minds could agree with these. Whenever he was compelled to perform by the king’s order, he attempted to change the intellects [of the listeners] by a variety of sounds. With a high singing of unusual severity, he first filled the listeners with a kind of sadness and numbness, then with more vigorous sounds. They stood with him applauding with delighted minds and bodies, wantonly moving, gesturing, and bending. Finally, in a sharper manner, he rapidly stirred a great spirit of fury, as a frenzy to madness, proceeding to rashness.#t_footnote(1582)[9]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    We also read that in Apulia, when those who were touched by a venomous spider became stupefied and layed down as if dead, each of the listeners rose when hearing certain sounds and danced to the rhythm,, afterward growing stronger. If after a long time they heard a similar sound, they would be quickly moved to dance.#t_footnote(1583)[10] It is believed, as Gellius wrote, that a flute melody lessens the pain for those who are ill with a great hip pain. It is also written by Theophrastus that viper bites are cured by a flute melody, and Democritus acknowledged that flute harmonies are a medicine for many illnesses of men.#t_footnote(1584)[11]

    Chapter 25. Of sound and harmonies, and from where their wonderfulness in operation comes.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    If we agree with Pythagoras and Plato that the heavens are harmoniously composed, governed, and accomplished by harmonious tones and motions, we will not deny that sounds have a virtue for receiving celestial gifts. However, the sounds of singing are more powerful than instruments, inasmuch as harmonious singing is conceived from the mind and powerful fantasies, moved from the heart, and then scattered by air. The temperate air of the listener’s spirit, which is the bond of the soul and the body, easily penetrates and transfers the affection and intellect of the singer and moves the disposition of the listener by its affection. Fantasy affects fantasy, and intellect does likewise to intellect. Likewise, [song affects] the beating of the heart, enters the inner mind, and slowly influences their character. It moves members and stops the humors of the body.#t_footnote(1585)[1] Hence, it confers such a great harmony by moving the affections that not only natural but also artificial and vocal harmonies bring strength to the soul and body.#t_footnote(1586)[2]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But it is necessary that all harmonies come from appropriate foundations: either from stringed instruments, pipes, or vocals, if they should come together as one. Nor indeed should one make the roaring of a lion, the lowing of an ox, the neighing of a horse, the bellowing of an ass, or the grunting of a pig, nor would a stringed instrument made from the sinews of a wolf and lamb [together] be brought into any harmony, because their foundations are dissonant.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Yet the voices of many and diverse men agree because they are of a single species and have a foundation, just as many birds agree because their species are related to each other and are tokens to their superior. Artificial instruments and natural voices agree because they are either similar, true and imitative, or have a certain analogy.#t_footnote(1587)[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But all harmonies are sounds or voices. Sounds are a breath, voice is a sound and animated breath,#t_footnote(1588)[4] and conversation is breath with sound and voice signifying something, whose breath with sound and voice proceed from the mouth. Chalcidius said that voice is sent from the inner place of the breast and heart and sent out by the shining spirit, where sinews overgrow, separating the heart from the lungs and other vitals, where the pulsating narrow passage of the pharynx forms the tongue and other vocal organs producing distinct sounds. The elements of speech are indeed the interpreters uncovering the mind’s arcane motions.#t_footnote(1589)[5] However, Lactantius said that the voice has a very obscure reasoning, as it is not entirely comprehended as to how or why it happens.#t_footnote(1590)[6]
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Where music is located.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Finally, all music is contained in voice, sound, and hearing. Sound without air cannot be heard since while air is necessary to be able to hear, air by itself is not audible, nor can any senses touch it, unless by accident. Indeed, sight cannot see unless [things] are colored, nor things heard unless with sound, nor smell unless with scent, nor tasted unless with taste, nor touched unless hot or cold, or the like.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, although sound is impossible without air, sound is not of the nature of air, nor air of the nature of sound, but the body of life of our sensitive spirit arises from air and is not of the nature of any sensitive object, but of the more simple and other virtues. The sensitive soul should vivify the air joined to it. In vivifying and joining with spirit, air perceives the species of objects placed in action and those vivified in air: these are visible in diaphanous and subtle species, in common [they are audible], in gross species [they are with] other senses.

  #p_normal[
    Now, you must know that of the seven planets, Saturn, Mars, and the Moon have more of a voice than the harmonies of the rest. Saturn has sad, hoarse, grave, and slow voices that sound as if he were restricted to the center. However, Mars is crude, sharp, threatening, swift, and angry. Among all of these, the Moon observes the middle. But Jupiter, the Sun, Venus, and Mercury have harmonies: yet Jupiter has grave, steady, eager, sweet, cheerful, and pleasant harmonies. The Sun has the venerable, eager, pure, and with sweet grace. Venus has the playful, luxurious, soft, delightful, publicly dissolute, and wide. However, Mercury has relaxed and changeable harmonies, happy, pleasant, and with a certain strenuousness.#t_footnote(1591)[1]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But particular harmonies and proportional tones obey the nine Muses; Jupiter has the grace of the octave and fifth—namely, the diapason with #emph[diapente]. The Sun has the melody of the octave voice—namely, the diapason—and likewise through fifteenth tones a #emph[disdiapason]. Venus has the grace of the fifth voice—namely, the #emph[diapente]. Mercury has the #emph[diatessaron]—namely, the grace of a fourth.#t_footnote(1592)[2]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Additionally, the ancients tensed the #emph[tetrachord]#t_footnote(1593)[3] like the number of elements. Mercury invented the four chords, as Nicomachus wrote, with the #emph[hypate]#t_footnote(1594)[4] being earth, the #emph[parhypate] or middle#t_footnote(1595)[5] note was water, the highest or #emph[diezeugmenon] or #emph[hyperbolaeos] is fire, #emph[paranete]#t_footnote(1596)[6] or #emph[synemmenon ]is assigned to air. However, Terpander of Lesbos later discovered seven chords, those equaling the number of planets.#t_footnote(1597)[7]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Additionally, they said that four kinds of music followed the four elements and agreed with the four humors, and thought that Dorian agreed with water and phlegm, Phrygian with choler and fire, Lydian with sanguine and air, and Mixolydian with black bile and earth. Others respecting the number and virtue of the celestials assigned Dorian for the Sun, Phrygian for Mars, Lydian for Jupiter, Mixolydian for Saturn, Hypophrygian for Mercury, Hypolydian for Venus, Hypodorian for the Moon, and Hypomixolydian for the starry heaven.

    These modes of harmony also refer to the Muses and strings with the heavens, but not in the order that we have written of the nine Muses among numbers and celestial souls.

    Also, there are several who find the harmonies of the heavens from their distance from each other; for that space that lies between the Earth and Moon—namely, 126,000 Italian 
#emph[stadia]#t_footnote(1602)[12]—makes an interval of a tone. However, from the Moon to Mercury, being half of that space makes a semitone. It is just as much from that to Venus making another semitone. But from there to the Sun is as it were a threefold and a half tone makes a 
#emph[diapente]. From the Moon to the Sun is twice as much and a half making a 
#emph[diatessaron]. However, from the Sun to Mars is again as much of an interval as from the Earth to the Moon, making a tone. From there to Jupiter is half that, making another semitone. It is just as much from there to Saturn, also making a semitone. From there to the starry orb again has space of a semitone lying between them. Therefore, from the Sun to the starry orb has a 
#emph[diatessaron] interval of two and a half tones. However, from the Earth to the end is a 
#emph[diapason] of six whole tones.

    Therefore, the particular motion of the Moon makes a swifter and sharper sound than the starry orb, which makes slower and deeper sound; but the violent motion of the

This proportionate motion and reciprocation gives the sweetest harmony.#t_footnote(1606)[16] Hence, no songs, sounds, and musical instruments are more powerful in moving a man’s affections and inducing magical impressions than those composed from numbers, measures, and proportions according to their celestial equals.

    Man, because he is the most beautiful work of God, is His image. Man is the lesser world, and is, therefore, the most perfect composition and sweetest harmony. He is the most sublime dignity, containing and sustaining in himself all numbers, measures, weights, motions, and elements. Everything else is composed in him as if by a supreme art, pursuing a certain fate more supreme and beyond all common harmonies than in other compositions.

    Hence, the ancients once counted and indicated numbers with their fingers, and they seem to have proved that all numbers, measures, proportions, and harmonies are found in the joints of the human body. Accordingly, temples, shrines, houses, theaters, ships, and machines, every kind of skill, artifice, and buildings, and each of their parts (for example columns, capitals, pedestals, aisles, stylobates,#t_footnote(1610)[1] and others of this kind), all share and are deduced from the symmetry of the human body. This is why God taught Noah how to make the ark from the measure of the human body: He made the entire scheme of the world symmetrical to the human body, and hence it is called the great world, while the human body is called the lesser.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, of the microcosm, some people measure the human body by six feet—that is, a foot by ten degrees and each degree by five minutes. From this is counted 60 degrees, which makes 300 minutes and is equal to an entire geometrical cube. This is described in the ark of Moses. Hence, as the human body is 300 minutes in length, 50 in width, and 30 in height, the length of the ark [of Noah] was 300 cubits, 50 wide, and 30 in height.#t_footnote(1611)[2] In both places the length and width was sixfold#t_footnote(1612)[3] in proportion, in height tenfold, and the width and height about two thirds. In a similar way, the symmetries of all members [of the body] are proportionate, agree, and are appropriate with the members of the world and measures of the Archetype. There is no member in man that does not respond to some sign, star, intelligence, or divine name in the Archetype, which is God Himself.

    Also, the squared measure is the most proportional body—that is, if a man stands erect with his arms spread and feet together, he makes an equilateral square, whose center is in the lower pubis.

  #p_normal[
    If a circle is made over the same center from the top of the head, with the arms lowered until the ends of the fingers touch the circumference of the circle, and the feet are spread in that same circumference as far as the tips of the fingers distant from the top of the head and the center of the circle placed over the lower pubis and divided into five equal parts, then that circle constitutes a perfect pentagram and the heels of the feet make a perfect equilateral triangle with the navel.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    If the heels are not moved, with the left and right feet stretched on each side and the hands elevated to a line above the head, then the tips of the fingers and toes make an equilateral square, whose center is above the navel in the middle the body.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    If the hands are thus elevated, and the feet and legs are spread in this manner where a man is shortened by a fourteenth part of his erect stature, then with the feet separated referring to the lower pubis, it makes a triangle of equal sides. The center is placed in the navel, a circle surrounding it touches the ends of the hands and feet.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    If the hands are extended high over the head with the elbow equal to the crown of the head and the man stands with his feet together, placed into an equilateral square by the extremes of his hands and feet, then the center of that square is in the navel, and that same center is between the top of the head and the knees.

    Now we come to particular measures: encircling a man under his armpits is the central point of his length, whose middle is the lower pubis. However, up to the middle of the breast between each nipple and from the middle of the breast to the top of the head in both places is a fourth part. Similarly, from the lower pubis to under the knees, to the ends of the feet in man is a fourth part. The width from the end of one shoulder to the other is [also a fourth part]. It is the same length from the elbow to the end of the long finger and is therefore called a 
#emph[cubit].#t_footnote(1614)[5] Hence, four cubits constitute the length of a man; however, the width of the shoulders is one cubit, but encircling it is one foot. A cubit is made up of six palms, but a foot is four [palms], four fingers a palm, and the entire length of a man is twenty-four palms, six feet, ninety-six fingers. From the pubis to the top of the breast is six parts in length.#t_footnote(1615)[6] From the top of the breast to the top of the forehead and the roots of the hair is a seventh#t_footnote(1616)[7] part in length. A strong and well-squared body is six feet long, but a taller is seven. As Varro and Gellius testify, a human body cannot exceed seven feet in height.#t_footnote(1617)[8]

    Finally, the diameter of the waist is the [same] space as the heel of a hand to the inner folding of the elbow. From the breast to the top of the nipples to the top lip, or downward to the navel, and which between the ends of the bones at the top of the breast surrounding the throat and which from the soles of the feet to the end of the calf,#t_footnote(1618)[9] and from there to the kneecap, are all coequal and constitute a seventh of the total height.

    The head of a man from the bottom of the chin to the top of the head is an eighth part of his length. This is the same as the length from the elbow to the end of the shoulder. It is the same as the diameter of the waist of a tall man.

  #p_normal[
    The circle of the head, from the top of the forehead to the bottom of the base of the back of the head, makes a fifth part of the total length [of the body]. This is identical with the width of his breast.

  #p_normal[
    Nine faces constitute a squared and well-set man; however, a tall man is ten. Therefore, the length of a man is shared in nine portions, the face from the top of the forehead to the end of the chin is one. Then from the bottom of the throat or top of the breast to the top of the stomach is another. From there to the navel is the third; from there to the bottom of the thigh is the fourth; from the hip to the knees constitutes two; from there to the ankle of the foot and leg gives two others, [the total] of all of these parts is eight. Similarly, the curve from the top of the forehead to the top of the head, and then from the chin to the top of the breast and throat, and also from the ankle to the sole of the foot: these three spaces connected make nine. Likewise, the width of the breast has two parts and [totaling the length of] each arm [makes] seven.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, ten faces constitute the body, these being the most proportional. Therefore, of these, the first portion is from the top of the head to the bottom of the nose. From there to the top of the breast is the second. Consequently, to the top of the stomach is the third. From there to the navel is the fourth. From there to the bottom of the pubis is the fifth, which is the middle of the length of man. From there to the ends of the soles are another five parts, which joined to the first together make ten; hence, all bodes are measured by the most proportionate equal measurement.

    The face of man from the bottom of the chin to the top of the forehead and the bottom of the roots of the hair is a one-tenth part. From the heel of a man’s hand to the end of his longest finger is also one part. Also, between the points of both nipples is one part. From each [of those] to the bottom of the throat makes an equilateral triangle. The width of the lower forehead, from one ear to the other, is one part. The total width of the breast—namely, from the top of the breast to where the shoulders join in both places—is one part, which makes two. The circle of the head, moving across the gap of the eyebrows from the forehead all the way to end of the back of the head where the hair ends, is also two parts. From the outside of the upper arm to the joints of the hands, and the inside from armpits to the borders of the palms and fingers is three parts. The circle of the head through the middle of the forehead has three parts. The circle of the waist has four parts in a strong man, but a delicate body has three and a half parts, or of such size as from the top of the breast to the lower pubis. The circle of the breast through the armpits to the back has five parts—that is, as much total length as the middle. From the top of the head to the Adam’s apple is two-thirteenths#t_footnote(1619)[10] of the entire height. If the arms are lifted high, the elbows are at the top of the head.

    Now we will see how the rest of the symmetries are equal to each other: the distance from the chin to the top of the breast is as much as the width of the neck.#t_footnote(1620)[11] The distance from the top of the breast to the navel is as much as the circumference of the neck.#t_footnote(1621)[12] The distance from the chin to crown of the head is as much as the width of the waist. The distance from between the eyes to the bottom of the nose is as much as from the bottom of the throat to the chin. The distance from the top of the nose to the chin is as much as from the top throat to the bottom. From between the eyes to the inner corner of the eye socket and the top of the projection of the nose, and from the bottom of the nose to the end of the upper lip, are three equals among each other. From the top of the nail of the index finger to the bottom joint, and the place where the hand is joined to the arm on the outside, and likewise on the inside from the top of the nail of the middle finger to the bottom joint and the bottom of the hand, all are proportionally equal to each other.

    The larger joint on the index finger is equal to the height of the forehead. The remaining two to the end of the nail are equal to the nose—that is, from between the eyes at the top of the nose to the bottom, and the largest joint in the middle finger is equal to that space, which is from the bottom of the nose to the end of the chin. The second joint on the middle finger is as much as from the bottom of the chin to the top of the bottom lip. However, the third is as much as from the mouth to the end of the nose, but the entire hand is as great as the entire face.

    The greater joint on the thumb is as much as the opening of the mouth and what is from the bottom of the chin to the top of the lower lip. However, the smaller [joint] is as much as from the top of the bottom lip to the end of the nose. The ends [joints] of all the fingers, which are called 
#emph[onychios,] have the nails at their center points.

    From between the eyes to the outside corner of the eye is as much as from that corner to the beginning of the ears. The height of the forehead, the length of the nose, and the width of the mouth through the top lip are equal to each other. Likewise, the width of the palms and feet are equal. The height that is from the bottom of the ankle to the top of the feet is equal to the length that is from the top of the feet to the end of the nail. From the top of the forehead to the gap between the eyes, and from there to the bottom of the nose, and then to the end of the chin are equal parts. The juncture of the eyebrows is equal to the circles of the eyes, and the semicircle of the ear is equal to the opening of the mouth: thus, the circles of the eyes, ears, and opening of the mouth are equal. The width of the nose is as much as the length of the eye: hence that space which is between the ends of both eyes—the eyes having two parts, not counting the third [distance the width of an eye] which takes up the middle of the nose.#t_footnote(1622)[13]

    From the top of the head to the knees makes the navel the center. From the top of the breast to the bottom of the nose makes the Adam’s apple the center. The eyes are placed in the center from the top of the head to the bottom of the chin. The bottoms of the ears are in the center from the space between the eyes to the end of the chin. The end of the bottom lip is the center from the bottom of the nose to the bottom of the chin. The same distance is a third part from the bottom of the nose to the top lip.

    All of these measures are through many proportions and well-balanced harmonies that agree with each other: for instance, the largest finger—which is the thumb—is to the end of the arm#t_footnote(1623)[14] at the pulse and joint of the hand a two and a half proportion in a circular measure#t_footnote(1624)[15]; indeed, this is two and a half, as five is to two. However, the relation [of the wrist] to the upper arm near the shoulder is threefold. The size of the shin is to that of the arm a proportion of one and a half, as three is to two. It is a similar proportion for the neck to the shin as that to the arm. The proportion of the hip to the arm is threefold. The proportion of the entire body to the trunk is nine-eighths. From the trunk or upper body to the leg, all the way to the soles of the feet, is four thirds. The breast from the neck to the navel, to loin or womb all the way to the trunk is double. The width of that to width of the hip is one and a half. From the head to the neck is threefold. Likewise, the head to the knee is threefold, and the same to the thigh and shoulder.#t_footnote(1625)[16] The length of the forehead between the temples is quadruple the height.

    These are the measures that are found everywhere, with which the members of the human body according to the length, width, height, and circumference agree. They are in harmony with each other and with the heavens themselves. All of these numbers share many proportions, fractions, or mixtures, from which results a many-layered harmony. Indeed, a double proportion makes three 
#emph[diapasons,] a quadruple twice a #emph[diapason,] and #emph[diapente]. In the same way, the elements, qualities, complexions, and humors are proportional: for these weights of humors and complexions are assigned to a healthy and well-composed man. They are as follows: for blood eight, phlegm four, choler two, and melancholy one. In both places are in a double proportion through the order, but the first [humor] to the third and second to the fourth are quadrupled, but the first to the last are eightfold.#t_footnote(1626)[17]

    The eternal Maker of the world sends out the soul into the body, just as if it were a house: first, [this house is] made worthy for lodging, and gives [the soul] the noblest intellect and most beautiful body. Then the mind itself, conscious of its own divinity, molds and adorns [this house] for its own character. Hence, the people of Ethiopia who were ruled by wise Gymnosophists (as written by Aristotle), did not create kings by their strength and wealth, but by their most beautiful and most excellent form. This was because they observed that [the kings’] magnificent minds were in turn copied to their bodies.#t_footnote(1631)[22] Many ancient and recent philosophers have considered this, and probed into the secret causes of nature hidden in its majesty. They boldly asserted that there were no faults and disproportions in the body, which the fault and intemperance of the mind did not follow, because it is certain that they emerge and unify and operate with each other.

Indeed, the intellect shows its way to the will as a light to the eye; yet it does not move by itself but awaits the mistress of its operations, which is why it is called free will. Although it always tends toward good as an object equal to itself, it is yet sometimes blinded by error, and is impelled to the animal powers and chooses evil believing it is good.

Also, there is nothing more effective for chasing away evil daemons than musical harmonies: those who fell from heaven are an enemy to true agreement and are unable to support it and flee from those harmonies. It is just as when David held back the wicked spirit from the raving Saul with his cithara.

The colors of the planets are as follows:#t_footnote(1656)[1] Saturn is bluish or leaden and shining in these [colors]; Jupiter is citron, almost pale, and with these is clear; Mars is red and fiery; the Sun is yellow and when rising is glowing, and afterward radiant; Venus is white, but as Lucifer shining, however as Vesperus#t_footnote(1657)[2] gleaming; Mercury is radiant; the Moon pale.#t_footnote(1658)[3] Likewise, know the fixed stars by how much greater, brighter, and apparent they are; the greatest and strongest in their significations#t_footnote(1659)[4] are those stars which astrologers call the first and second magnitude.

    #emph[The excellence of the Sun.]

  #p_normal[
    The Sun is the lord of all elementary virtues. The Moon, by the virtue of the Sun, rules generation, increase, and decrease. Hence, Albumasar#t_footnote(1681)[1] said that life is infused into everything by the Sun and Moon, which therefore Orpheus called the vivifying eyes of the sky. The Sun gives light from itself to all, and to all, it abundantly gives [light] not only to the sky and air but also to the earth and the deepest abyss. Whatever is good that we have, as Iamblichus said, we have from the Sun, either [directly] from it alone, or through other things. Heraclitus called the Sun the fountain of heavenly light, and many Platonists placed the World Soul principally with the Sun, because the Sun entirely fills the globe, and sends out its rays to all sides as if it were a spirit. [It passes] through all, distributing life, perception, and motion to everything. Hence, ancient natural philosophers called the Sun the heart of the heavens and the Chaldeans placed it in the center of the planets. Likewise, the Egyptians placed it in the center of the world—that is, they placed it between two worlds [consisting of groups] of five, with the Sun placed over five planets, but under the Sun are placed the Moon and four elements.#t_footnote(1682)[2]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Among the rest of the stars, [the Sun] is the image and statue of the highest prince, light of both the terrestrial and celestial worlds, and exact likeness of God, whose essence is the Father, its splendor the Son, and its heat the Holy Ghost, [a revelation] to such an extent that the academy had nothing greater to show the expression of the Divine Essence. So great is its agreement to God that Plato called it the visible Son of God,#t_footnote(1683)[3] Iamblichus called it the image of the divine intelligence,#t_footnote(1684)[4] and our Dionysius called it the evident statue of God.#t_footnote(1685)[5]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    It sits as a king in the center of the other planets, excelling in all light, magnitude, and beauty, illuminating all, and distributing virtue to them for disposing the inferiors, regulating and disposing their movements so that their movements are called diurnal or nocturnal, southern or northern, oriental or occidental, direct or retrograde. Just as by its light it chases away the darkness of night, it thus also [chases away] the powers of darkness, of which Job#t_footnote(1686)[6] said: “When the morning first appeared, they believe it is the shadow of death”; and in the Psalms,#t_footnote(1687)[7] speaking about the young lions asking God for permission to devour, said: “The Sun has risen and they are gathered together lying in their lairs”; which when chased away, followed: “Man shall go forth for their work.”#t_footnote(1688)[8]

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, since the Sun holds the middle region of the world, and as the heart is [in the middle] of the whole body in animals, thus the Sun is in charge of the sky and world, having command over the whole world and that which is in it. It is the author of time, from whom come days and years, cold and heat, and other qualities of time. As Ptolemy said, when it reaches the location of any star, it excites the power [the star] has in air.#t_footnote(1689)[9] As such, it provokes heat with Mars, cold with Saturn, and disposes the spirit and mind of man himself. Of this it is said by Homer, and approved by Aristotle, that such movements in the mind are like what the Sun as prince and governor of the planets brings to us.#t_footnote(1690)[10]

    The Moon is the neighbor of Earth, the receptacle of all celestial influences. The speed of its course is joined with the Sun, the other planets, and the stars in a single month. It is a wife to all of the stars, the most fertile star, receiving the rays and influences of the Sun and other planets and stars as if fertile and begetting to the neighboring inferior world as if it were pregnant. Indeed, all the stars infuse into it, receiving [even] the farthest. It then communicates the influences of all superiors to the more inferiors and pours them back to the Earth, and more clearly disposes to these inferiors than the others. Its motion is more perceptible because of its familiarity and closeness to us. It is a medium between the superiors and inferiors, communicating everything.

    Therefore, its movement must be watched before the others as if it were a parent to all conceptions. It sets forth to the inferiors according to their various complexions, motions, situations, and aspects to the planets and other diverse stars. Although it receives the virtues from all stars, [it receives] most prominently from the Sun, as they join daily. It is replenished with a vivifying virtue, and according to its aspect, changes its complexion: for in its first quarter, as the Peripatetics said, it is hot and moist, in its second hot and dry, in its third cold and dry, and in its fourth cold and moist. Although it is the lowest star, it brings forth all conceptions from the superiors.

    Indeed, from it, the celestials begin their sequence of things that Plato called the golden chain, where each thing or cause is connected to the other, depending on the superior until they reach the Supreme Cause, from which everything depends. Hence, without the Moon intermediating, we cannot entirely attract the powers of the superiors; of which Thabit commanded that to entice some celestial virtue, we must take a stone or herb for that star when the Moon happily approaches that star or happily aspects it.#t_footnote(1691)[11]

    Chapter 33. Of the twenty-eight mansions of the Moon and their virtues.

  #p_normal[
    Because the Moon traverses the entire zodiac in the space of twenty-eight days, the wise Indians and most ancient astrologers granted twenty-eight Lunar mansions. Fixed in the eighth sphere, they hold the various constellations and stars, from which, as Alphaus said, they obtained different qualities and names. While the Moon travels through these, it obtains one or another powers and virtues.#t_footnote(1692)[1] The mansions, according to the opinion of Abraham,#t_footnote(1693)[2] are contained in 12 degrees, 51 minutes and almost 26 seconds; the names of which [mansions] and likewise their beginnings in the zodiac within the eighth sphere are these.#t_footnote(1694)[3]

    Chapter 34. Of the true motion of the celestials to be observed in the eighth sphere and the rationale of the planetary hours.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Whoever works for a suitable celestial, must observe one or both—that is, the motions or times of the stars: I say motion when they are in their dignities or debilities,#t_footnote(1728)[1] either essential or accidental;#t_footnote(1729)[2] but I say time when they are distributed in the days and hours of their rulership. All of these things are taught abundantly enough in books of astrologers, but we will especially consider and observe two such considerations here. The first is that as we observe the motions of the stars, their ascensions, and angles,#t_footnote(1730)[3] as they are in truth located in the eighth sphere. Because of the neglect of this fact, many people err in their fabrication of celestial images and are defrauded of desired effects.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The other thing we must observe concerns the times for finding planetary hours; indeed, almost all astrologers divide the time interval from the rising of the Sun to the setting into 12 equal parts and called them the 12 hours of the day. Then in a similar rationale, they shared in 12 equal portions the time following from setting to rising, and they called them the 12 hours of night. They then distributed those hours to each single planet according to their order of succession, always giving the first hour of the day to the planet ruling the day, then each in order to the end of 24 hours.#t_footnote(1731)[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Magicians assent to this distribution, but in the distribution of the hours themselves, some disagree, saying that the interval of rising and setting are not divided into equal parts. Therefore, those hours are not called unequal because diurnal and nocturnal are unequal, but because diurnal and nocturnal are unequal among each other. Therefore, there is another rationale of measurement distributing inequality or planetary hours observed by magicians, which is this: of course, being artificial hours, which are always coequal, a single artificial hour consists of the ascensions of 15 equinoctial degrees. Therefore, likewise in the planetary hours, the ascensions of 15 ecliptical degrees constitute a planetary or unequal hour, which is a measure one must examine and discover from tables of oblique ascension for each region.

    Chapter 35. How artificial things, such as images, sigils, and the like, obtain some virtues from celestial bodies.

  #p_normal[
    So great is the magnitude, strength, and power of the celestials that not only natural things but also artificial things, when duly exposed to the superiors, suddenly experience a most powerful agent and wonderful life from above,#t_footnote(1732)[1] which often gives them a wonderful celestial virtue.#t_footnote(1733)[2] The divine teacher Saint Thomas Aquinas confirmed this in his book 
#emph[On Fate,] where he said that even garments and any artificial works accept certain qualities from the stars.#t_footnote(1734)[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Thus, magicians not only mix and apply natural things but also images, sigils, rings, mirrors, and other suitable instruments—that is, fabricated under a certain constellation. A certain celestial enlightenment is captured, and they can secure something wonderful.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed, the celestial bodies are animated, alive, sensual, and grant wonderful and most vehement powers, even in a sudden moment, and suddenly touch images to imprint wonderful virtues—even in less suitable materials. Yet they grant more effective virtues in images if they are not fabricated from anything but certain materials—that is, whose natural and specific virtues likewise agree with the operation and the figure of the image is similar to the celestial figure.#t_footnote(1735)[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    In fact, such an image, because of the operation of the natural material and agreement with celestial influences, and because of the similarity of the figure with the celestial figure, is most prepared for the actions and powers of the celestial bodies. Capturing the figures, it suddenly receives the celestial gifts into itself, and then continually acts on one or other things by obediently linking to it. This is why Ptolemy in #emph[Centiloquy] said that inferior things obey the celestials—not only them but also their images:#t_footnote(1736)[5] as earthly scorpions not only obey the celestial Scorpio but also the image of Scorpio, which was suitably made under that rising and dominating figure.

    Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius constitute the fiery triplicity, are oriental, and are useful against fever, paralysis,#t_footnote(1739)[3] dropsy, gout, and against all cold and phlegmatic illnesses. They bring the bearer [of their engraved image] grace, eloquence, cleverness, and honor, because they are the domiciles of Mars, the Sun, and Jupiter.#t_footnote(1740)[4] They likewise made an image of a lion against melancholic fantasies, fevers, and for expelling illnesses in the hour of the Sun in the first degree of the second face#t_footnote(1741)[5] of Leo rising,#t_footnote(1742)[6] which indeed is the face and decanate of Jupiter.

The image of Cancer is most effective against serpents and poisons, when the Sun and Moon are conjunct in the ascendant in the first or third face; indeed, [the first face] is the face of Venus, and decanate of the Moon, and [the third] is the face of the Moon, decanate of Jupiter; they also say it torments serpents when the Sun is in Cancer.

    Now there are other images that are attributed to the planets, although these were written in very large volumes by the wise ancients so that there is nothing to say in this work, yet I will name a few of these here. Indeed, for the operations of Saturn, [with Saturn] in the ascendant, in a stone called a magnet, make an image of a man with the face of a deer and the feet of a camel, sitting on a chair or dragon, his right hand holding a sickle, in his left an arrow; indeed, they expected this image to be useful for a long life. Indeed, Saturn brings long life which was approved in Albumasar’s #emph[Sadan,] where he also wrote of certain regions of India where men are subject to Saturn, and they live to a great age and do not die except from extreme old age.#t_footnote(1754)[1]

They made it in the day of Mercury, in the third hour—that is, the hour of Saturn—with Gemini rising, this being the domicile of Mercury and which signifies prophets. [They made this metal image when] Saturn and Mercury were conjunct in Aquarius, in the ninth region#t_footnote(1758)[5] of the sky, which is called God; additionally, [they fashioned it] with Saturn aspecting the ascendant by a trine, and likewise the Moon and the Sun aspecting the place by conjunction. [They created this image with] Venus placed in some angle—powerful and occidental—and when Mars was combust the Sun but not aspecting Saturn or Mercury.

    Additionally, there are other figures made by numbers and position of the stars and that are appointed to elements, planets, and signs. These are called geomancy because diviners in geomancy cast lots by making pricks [in the earth] and reduce them into figures by counting these to see whether it is even or odd. When these are engraved or impressed under the lordship of the planets and stars, they conceive virtues and powerful images. These figures are, as it were, a middle between images and characters. Those who wish to know the natures of these figures, their qualities, conditions, significations, and stellar influences must carefully study books on geomancy.

  #p_normal[
    For making something fortunate, we make the image in which these are fortunate—that is, the significator of life, the givers of life,#t_footnote(1793)[1] signs, and planets. We also make fortunate the ascendant, midheaven, and their lords; likewise, the place of the Sun, place of the Moon, the Part of Fortune, the lord of conjunction or prevention before their nativity,#t_footnote(1794)[2] and malevolent planets suppressed. However, if we wish to make images for destruction, we must act to the contrary to that which was fortunate, we put in an unfortunate place, rising malevolent stars. Act in a similar way for making some place, region, city, or home fortunate.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Likewise, for destroying or impeding something of what is said above, make an image under the ascendant of that thing which you wish to destroy or impede. Make unfortunate the lord of the house of his life,#t_footnote(1795)[3] the lord of the ascendant and the Moon, the lord of the house of the Moon, the lord of the house of the lord of the ascendant, the lord of the tenth, and the lord [of the thing itself]. But for the suitability of some place, put the fortunes in the ascendant and in the first house, the tenth, second, and eighth, and make the lord of the ascendant fortunate and the lord of the house of the ruler of the ascendant, make the Moon fortunate, and the lord of the house of the Moon.#t_footnote(1796)[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    To make certain animals flee from a certain place, so that they will not be able to generate, live, or persist, make an image under the ascendant of that animal that we wish to chase away and the like. For example, if we wish to chase away scorpions from some place, make an image of a scorpion, rising in the sign of Scorpio with the Moon, and make the ascendant and its lord unfortunate, as well as the lord of the house of Mars. Make the lord of the ascendant unfortunate in the eighth and join them in a malevolent aspect, opposite or square. Inscribe in the image the name of the ascendant and its lord, the name of the Moon, the name of the lord of the day, and the name of the lord of the hour. Then make a pit in the middle of the place, from where you wish to drive out [the scorpions], and bring into it earth taken from the four corners of the same place#t_footnote(1797)[5] and bury the image there, head down, praying or mentioning: “This is the grave of scorpions, so that they will not enter this place,” and similar statements of this kind.#t_footnote(1798)[6]

  #p_normal[
    For profit, make an image under the ascendant of the nativity of a man or under the ascendant of that place#t_footnote(1799)[7] from where you wish to gain profit. Make fortunate the ascendant and its lord and make the lord of the second house, which is the house of substance, joined with the lord of the ascendant in a trine or sextile, with a reception between them. Make fortunate the eleventh and its lord and the eighth; and if possible, place the Part of Fortune in the ascendant or the second; and bury the image in that place or carry it from there to where you wish to gain profit.#t_footnote(1800)[8]

    For friendship and love, make an image on the day of Jupiter, under the ascendant of the nativity of the one who you wish to love. Make the ascendant and tenth fortunate, and hide evil from the ascendant. Have the lord of the tenth and eleventh be fortunate planets, joined with the lord of the ascendant in a trine or sextile with reception. Then make the other image—that is, for the one you wish to inspire and love—consider if it is a friend or a companion you wish to love: if so, make the image under the ascendant of the eleventh house from the ascendant of the first image. However, if it is made for a wife or husband, make it under the ascendant of the seventh; if a brother or sister, make it under the ascendant of the third and thus the like. Put the significator of the ascendant of the second image joined with the significator of the ascendant of the first image. Make a reception between them and the rest fortunate, as in the first image. Then join both images together in an embrace or place the face of the second image to the back of the first image and wrap them in fine linen and carry or bury them.#t_footnote(1801)[9]

  #p_normal[
    Likewise, for successful petitions and for gaining a thing denied, taken, or possessed by another, make an image under the ascendant of the one who desires the thing and make the lord of the second joined with the lord of the ascendant in a trine or sextile with a reception between them, and if possible have the lord of the second be in an obedient sign and the lord of the ascendant in a commanding sign. Make the ascendant fortunate and its lord, and make sure that the lord of the ascendant is not retrograde, combust, cadent, or in the opposite house—that is, in the seventh from their domicile, not impeded from malefics and fortunes in an angle. Make fortunate the ascendant, the lord of the second, and the Moon. Then make the other image for that which is petitioned and begin it under the ascendant concerning it; such as if it is a king or prince, begin under the ascendant of the tenth house from the ascendant of the first image, if a father under the fourth, if a son under the fifth, and so on. Put the significator of the second image joined with the lord of the ascendant of the first image, in a trine or sextile and in reception with each other, and place both strongly and fortunately without impediments. Make all malefics cadent from them, and if possible, make the tenth and fourth fortunate, or any of them. When the second image is complete, join it with the first, face to face, and wrap them in clean linen and bury them in the middle of house of the one who desired the thing, under a fortunate significator with the fortunes strong, and make the face of the first image face the north, or rather against the place where the thing desired is detained. If it happens that the petitioner goes to the place where the thing petitioned is [they should] carry the images with them for as far as they go.#t_footnote(1802)[10]

    There are also images made for dreams that are placed under the head of a sleeper who excels in causing dreams of truth for whatever thing the mind [of the sleeper] previously pondered: and the figure of it is the figure of a sleeping man in the bosom of an angel, which is made with Leo rising, the Sun in Aries posited in the ninth house. Then on the breast of the man, inscribe the name of the desired effect, but in the head of angel the name of the intelligence of the Sun. The same image is made with Virgo rising, with Mercury in Aries made fortunate in the ninth house, or Gemini rising, Mercury made fortunate and in Aquarius in the ninth, with Saturn happily aspecting with reception, and inscribe the name of the spirit#t_footnote(1803)[11] of Mercury. The same is also made with Libra rising, Venus in Gemini in the ninth house receiving Mercury, and inscribe the name of the angel of Venus. Again, the same image is made with Aquarius rising, Saturn in its exaltation which is Libra, well-placed in the ninth, and inscribed with the angel of Saturn.

    We have said above that certain images are not according to a similarity of celestial image but according to an emulation of what the mind of the operator desires; and for the same reason, certain characters are understood. Accordingly, characters of this kind are no more than badly unarticulated images, yet they have a certain plausible similarity with celestial images or the desires of the operator’s mind, whether it is from the entire image, or from some certain mark portraying the entire image: just as such characters of Aries and Taurus are from the forms of horns

    Similarly, the 120 [possible] conjunctions [of the planets] result in just as many composed characters with multilayered figures—that is,

  ]
  #p_normal[
    In the preceding, we have spoken of various different kinds of divination. However, it must be noted that all of these require the use and canons of astrology as a most necessary key for noticing all secrets, and all kinds of divination have their roots and foundations in astrology since, without it, little or nothing will seem to be accomplished.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Inasmuch as the celestials are causes and signs of all that exists and is made in the inferior [world], astrological divination grants the most certain demonstrations of whichever things are hidden or future from only the situation and motion of the celestial bodies. Of this we will say no more here, since huge volumes have been written of this knowledge by the ancients and are openly available everywhere.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, if a physiognomist inspects the body, face, forehead, or hands, or if a soothsayer scrutinizes a dream or auspice, the celestial figure must equally be scrutinized if the right future is to be judged. From the indications [of the celestial figure] along with the conjectures of the similarity of the signs [taken from other arts, one can] create truthful opinions of the significators.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But also if some portent appears in the sky, the celestial figure must be built. Also scrutinize the preceding revolutions of the years, great conjunctions,#t_footnote(1811)[1] and eclipses. Consider the nativity of the prince, nation, region, and city where [the portent] appeared, beginnings, coronations,#t_footnote(1812)[2] foundations, revolutions, profections,#t_footnote(1813)[3] directions, and that which is from them, and to which place the celestial figure falls. From all of these, we may finally find a rational and true signification of these things. With this same sequence, yet with less work, we can also explain dreams. Indeed, those who are entranced#t_footnote(1814)[4] in a frenzy do not predict the future unless agitated by the stars or inferior instruments of these; from where in the end, their predictions can be adapted by the celestials, just as we read in Lucan of the Etruscan prophet:

    after the city was purified, the victim sacrificed, and the entrails inspected, they finally pronounced their opinions from the dispositions of the stars in the heavens.

  #p_normal[
    Geomancy, the most accurate of lots, [is performed] by marking the earth or another surface, through divination by chance,#t_footnote(1816)[6] or by the power from certain inscriptions. [All of these processes] are first reduced from celestial figures—that is, to those sixteen [figures] named above. A judgment is formed in an astrological manner from those qualities and methods. Hence, they observed any of the more divine natural lots, whose power can be from no [other source] but from heaven and the mind of the operator. Accordingly, whatever is moved in these inferiors is moved, agitated and produced, by the movements of the superior influences, and necessarily imitates these. They are reduced from the roots, causes, and signs, just as [with geomancy, and thus] our opinions are likewise indicated from astrological rules.

    Hence, tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron dice made and inscribed with certain numbers, signs, and stars at opportune times under the celestial influences, obtain a wonderful divining virtue and predictions from throwing them, such as the Praenestian dice, in which were read the fates of the Romans.#t_footnote(1817)[7]

    Chapter 54. Of lots and from when and where the virtues of their divinations are produced.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Whatever divinations and human events that are predicted by lots, besides the lot itself, there must necessarily be some certain sublime, hidden, and occult cause, which indeed are not caused by accident such as how Aristotle described fortune;#t_footnote(1818)[1] because in the sequence of causes, since according to Platonists a cause by accident cannot be a first and sufficient cause, we must look higher to find a cause that recognizes and intends the effect. But this is not in corporeal nature, but in immaterial and incorporeal substances. These things truly administer lots and dispense indications of truth, to arrange [according to] the necessary such as in the human mind, different spirits and daemons, in the celestial intelligences, or in God Himself.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    It is well known that the human soul possesses sufficient power and virtue for directing lots of this kind, because there is a divine soul [of which our own souls are] a likeness. As we said in the first book, there is in our souls an apprehension and power of all things.#t_footnote(1819)[2] All things have a natural obedience to it, and necessarily have a motion and effectiveness to it. They desire what the soul strongly desires, and all virtues and operations of natural and artificial things obey it when brought into the great excess of its desire. All lots of any kind help the appetites of such souls and acquire for themselves wonderful virtues of prognostications—it is with these, and also from the opportune celestials in that hour, where these kinds of excessive appetites especially take hold.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    This same rationale is also the foundation of all astrological questions,#t_footnote(1820)[3] because the soul is elevated in some excessive desire and seizes for itself an hour and opportunity more appropriate and effective,#t_footnote(1821)[4] over which the celestial figure is made. Then the astrologer can judge and clearly recognize what the querent wishes to know and desires.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Because the human mind certainly does not always direct lots, but (as we have said), the office of other spirits sometimes direct lots, nor is the mind of the prophet always disposed to those that we said are excessive passions. Hence the ancients customarily sent forth certain ceremonies before casting lots, to which the divine intelligences and spirits were called in and rightly directed the lots.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, whatever prognostications these kinds of lots portend, must not come from accident or fortune but from a spiritual cause, whose power moves the imagination or the hand casting or drawing the lot,#t_footnote(1822)[5] whether that power comes from the soul of the operator by the great excess of his affection, from the influence and timing of the celestials, or from a certain divinity or spirit assisting and moving from the other side, whether these lots are done by casting knucklebones, set in motion by dice, or occur in verses, which were once done with the lots of Homer and Virgil. We read of these [lots] in Aelius Spartianus, that Hadrian once asked where the Emperor Trajan’s mind was toward him and came up with these verses:#t_footnote(1823)[6]

    Likewise, among the Hebrews and us Christians, and not disapproved of by certain theologians, are lots taken from verses of Psalms. There are many more kinds of lots: there are human lots, which predict nothing, that are observed by the ancients and us and are also entrusted by laws in choosing magistrates to avoid causing envy.#t_footnote(1826)[9] Cicero also makes mention in 
#emph[In Verrem],#t_footnote(1827)[10] but this is not our intention.

  #p_normal[
    However, divine and sacred lots are observed from oracles and religion, of these, we will discuss in the following book. In this way, I must admonish you that whatever presages, divinations, or predictions you learn from lots, these are not because of the lots themselves, but by virtue of some higher operation bound to them.

    The world, heavens, stars, and elements have a soul, with which a soul is caused in these inferior and mixed things. They also have a spirit, as was said in the previous book, that mediates their soul and is close to their body. The whole body of the world is a single body, whose parts are all living bodies. As much as the whole is more perfect and nobler than the parts, the world body is that much more perfect and nobler than a single living body. It would be absurd [to assert] that each small imperfect body, part of the world, and each lowly animal, such as flies and larvae are worthy, possess life, and have a soul, and the whole world itself—a more perfect, whole, and more perfect body—is not alive nor has a soul.#t_footnote(1835)[1] It is no less absurd that the heavens, stars, and elements, who most bountifully give a life and soul to each thing, are themselves without life and soul, and that any plants or trees would be nobler than the heavens, stars, and elements, that are naturally their cause.

  #p_normal[
    Indeed, who denies that earth and water are living, from which [elements] trees, plants, and animals generate, vivify, nourish, and increase, unless life were allotted [to them]? Thus, even the most obvious [example] appears in spontaneous births which have no corporeal seed. The elements could not generate and nourish life of this kind, if they themselves are without a life and soul.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Perhaps they might say that life of this kind is not produced from the souls of earth or water, but from the influence of celestial spirits; Platonists answer to this that accident cannot generate a substance#t_footnote(1836)[2] unless by chance, such as with an instrument that is exposed near the substances—but they say “near the substances,” because an instrument apart from the artist cannot be moved according to the effect of the art.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Thus also those celestial influences, since they are certain accidents far removed from their vital substances or from life itself, they will not generate vital substances in these inferiors.#t_footnote(1837)[3] Hermes [Trismegistus] wrote in his treatise #emph[Of the Common,] saying: “Everything that is in the world moves by increase or decrease.” Moreover, that which moves, therefore, lives. Since everything moves, also the earth—especially through generative and alterative motion—likewise lives. If one doubts the celestials live, Theophrastus said, they should not be thought as a philosopher,#t_footnote(1838)[4] and those who deny that the celestials are animated, therefore as a mover and not a form of it, destroys the foundations of all philosophy.#t_footnote(1839)[5] Therefore, the world lives, has a soul, and has perception. It accordingly gives life to [those] plants which are not generated from seed, and provides soul to [those] animals which are not born from intercourse.#t_footnote(1840)[6]

  #p_normal[
    That souls have reason, as we have said, is well known. The universal works of the souls, as we mentioned, conspire among themselves in a certain perpetual order. By necessity, they are not ruled by chance but by reason. According to that reason they direct and lead their operations toward certainties. Indeed, it is necessary that earth has reason of earthy things and water of watery things, and likewise in other things with each begetting in their time, place, and order, and often restoring injuries.#t_footnote(1841)[1]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, philosophers do not think that the Earth Soul is like a soul of some mere body, but rational, intelligent, and additionally a goddess.#t_footnote(1842)[2] Besides, it is absurd if we have reasons for our operations, and celestial souls and the Universal Soul do not have reasons for theirs.#t_footnote(1843)[3] If, as Plato said, the world is made from the Good itself, then it is made as well as it can be. It surely shares not only life, perception, and reason, but also intelligence and mind.#t_footnote(1844)[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Since the perfection of the body is the soul, and a more perfect body has a more perfect soul, it is therefore necessary that a celestial body—which is most perfect—also has the most perfect soul.#t_footnote(1845)[5] Therefore, they share an intellect and mind, which Platonists also prove by the persistence of [the celestials’] order and direction, because motion by their nature is free and easily able to be crooked, and in turn wander, unless regulated by an intelligence and mind. Indeed, that [mind] being perfect, it foresees from the beginning by the most chosen path, and the best ending. That perfect mind is the most powerful [attribute] of the soul. The World Soul, and the souls of the bodies of the celestials and elements, are as such without a doubt the most ordered and perfect for governing work appointed to them, since bodies do not resist more powerful souls, and perfect minds do not vary their deliberation.#t_footnote(1846)[6]

    Therefore, the World Soul is a certain single life filling everything, spreading over all, binding and connecting everything so that the whole world becomes one machine and as one instrument resounding from three kinds of creatures, intellectual, celestial and incorruptible,#t_footnote(1847)[7] with only one breath and one life.

  #p_normal[
    There are very many and diverse names for celestial souls, according to the various powers and virtues in these inferiors, from which many various names are assigned, which the ancients used in their hymns and invocations. One must note that every soul of this kind, according to Orphic theology, is said to have a double virtue: one placed in understanding, the other in allowing the vivifying and rulership of its body. In this way, Orpheus called the first virtue in the celestial spheres Bacchus. He called the other the Muse. Hence, one is not intoxicated by some Bacchus without first being connected with their Muse.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, they describe nine Bacchi around nine Muses. In the ninth sphere, Orpheus placed Bacchus Cribonius and the Muse Calliope; in the starry heaven Picionius and Urania; in the heaven of Saturn Amphietus and Polyhymnia; in the heaven of Jupiter, Sabasius and Terpsichore; in the heaven of Mars, Bassarius and Clio; in the heaven of the Sun Trietericus and Melpomene; in the heaven of Venus, Lysius and Erato; in the heaven of Mercury, Silenus and Euterpe; in the heaven of the Moon, Bacchus Lyaeus and the Muse Thalia.

  #p_normal[
    Likewise, in the elemental spheres, the souls are named in this way: in fire is placed Phanes and Aurora;#t_footnote(1849)[2] in air Jove, lord of lightning, and Juno; in water Oceanus and Thetys; in earth Pluto and Proserpina.#t_footnote(1850)[3]

    Likewise in each of the twelve constellations of the zodiac, Pythagoreans placed particular gods or souls in the hearts of those constellations, and thus ruled the entire constellation—that is, in the heart of Aries a particular Pallas; in the heart of Taurus a particular Venus; in Gemini a particular Phoebus; in Cancer Mercury; in Leo Jupiter; in Virgo Ceres; in Libra Vulcan; in Scorpio Mars; in Sagittarius Diana; in Capricorn Vesta; in Aquarius a particular Juno; in the heart of Pisces a particular Neptune.#t_footnote(1852)[5] Thus, Manilius listed in his verses: #emph[Manilius.]

    The most ancient Orpheus writing to the most distinguished Musaeus enumerated these heavenly gods and their various names, considerations, and duties assigned to them and made individual appeals to them with hymns. Therefore, no one should think that these are the names of evil and deceptive daemons but rather natural and divine virtues distributed to the world by God for the ministry and usefulness of man who knows their usefulness.#t_footnote(1855)[8]

  #p_normal[
    And the ancients themselves appointed each of these deities to each of the members of man, for example, the ear to Memoriae,#t_footnote(1856)[9] and which Virgil dedicated to Phoebus saying: #emph[. . . My ear Cynthius,]

Some dedicated the navel to Venus as the seat of luxury; others refer to it because it is the center to all the members, dedicate it to Jupiter; hence the effigy of an umbilicus is celebrated in the temple of Jupiter Ammon.#t_footnote(1858)[11] The ancients described many others, likewise their names are ascribed to each of the smallest members and joints; which if they are rightly understood and the true gods presiding over them recognized, nothing will alienate them from their loyal duty, since sacred speech testifies that all of our members are ruled by heavenly virtues,#t_footnote(1859)[12] of which more will be said in the following book.

    Hence, magicians who work through them use a clever invocation of the superiors, with mysterious words and a certain ingenious speech, drawing one to the other, yet with a natural strength by a certain mutual agreement between them. By these invocations, things voluntarily follow or are sometimes unwillingly drawn.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Thus, as it is said in Aristotle’s #emph[Of Mystical Philosophy,] book six, anyone who calls upon the Sun or the other stars with binding or bewitching, beseeching so that they cooperate with the desired operation, the Sun or stars will not hear that sermon. However, they are moved in some way by a certain natural connection and mutual sequence, where parts of the world are mutually subordinate to each other and have a mutual agreement according to their great union.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    So just as in the human body, one single member moves perceiving the movement of another, and in a cithara when a single string moves the others move; thus, when anyone moves some part of the world, the others perceive that motion. Therefore, the knowledge of the dependencies of things following each other is the foundation of all wonderful operations, which is necessarily required for exercising the power of attracting more superior virtues.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But the words of men are certain natural things because the parts of the world naturally draw each other and mutually act with one another. Therefore, a magician invokes by the operation of words through the suitable powers of nature, leading some by a love of one to the other, drawing according to one thing following the other, or repelling according to the hatred of one to the other by the contrariety and difference of things and multitude of virtues. Although they are opposite or different, they yet complete one part. He also sometimes compels things by a certain lordship of the celestial virtue, because he is not a stranger to the sky.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore man, if he receives the impression of some binding or bewitching, does not receive it according to the rational soul, but the sensual. If part of [a man] suffers, he suffers according to the animal and lower-world part. Indeed, they are not able to draw a knowing and intelligent [man] by reason, but by taking in that impression and attacking by sense, inasmuch as by the celestial influences and cooperation of worldly things, the animal spirit of man is affected beyond its pristine or completely natural disposition.

    This is like how the son moves the father to work: [with the father] protecting and graciously feeding the son, although wearied and even if reluctant. The appetite for domination moves one to irascibility and other labors for acquiring lordship. An indigent nature and a fear of poverty moves one to desire wealth. Ornaments and the beauty of women incite one to desire. The harmony of an experienced musician moves the hearer to various passions, of which some voluntarily follow the harmony of the art, others also conform themselves with a gesture also unwillingly, because their senses are captivated, not rationally intending to do these things.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But these kinds of bewitchings and bindings are not admired by the common people, nor [are they] detested, because [such things] are customary. However, they admire other physical things because they are ignorant and not accustomed to them; hence, they fall into errors,#t_footnote(1884)[1] thinking these things are above nature or against it because they are from nature and follow them.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, it must be known that each superior moves its nearest inferior in its degree and order not only in bodies but also in spirits. Thus, the universal soul moves particular souls, and the rational soul acts in the sensual, and [the sensual] in the vegetative. Any part of the world acts in others and each moves suitably according to the other: and any part of this inferior world suffers from the celestials according to its nature and aptitude, just as one part of an animal body suffers from another. The more superior intellectual world moves everything below it since it contains all that exists in the more inferior world from the first to the last.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, the celestial bodies move the elementary world (composed, generable, and sensible) from the furthest end#t_footnote(1885)[2] to the center by superior, perpetual, and spiritual essences by the primary intellect. [The primary intellect] is the acting intellect, into which God’s Word inserts a virtue. The wise Chaldeans of Babylon called that Word the cause of causes, because from it “being” is produced. The acting intellect follows it, but according to the union of this Word with the First Author, from which all existence is produced.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Thus, the Word is the likeness of God, the acting intellect is the likeness of the Word, the soul is the likeness of the intellect, but our word is the likeness of the soul, by which it naturally acts on natural things because nature is the work of it. And each one of those perfects the one following it, as a father his son, and nothing after exists without its prior. Indeed, they depend on each other, depending on a certain arrangement. When [that arrangement is] later corrupted, [it] reverts to the first nearest to it, until it reaches to the heavens, then the universal soul, afterward to the acting intellect, where all other creations exist, each existing in the First Author, which is the creating Word, to whom finally everything returns.#t_footnote(1886)[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, our soul must, if we wish to work some wonderful operation in these inferiors, examine its beginning, so that it is strengthened, that it is illuminated and receives acting power through each degree from that First Author. Therefore, this granting is an operation, as we contemplate the souls of the stars more than their bodies. The supercelestial and intellectual world are more than the celestial bodies, because they are nobler, although they are also distinguished and illuminated. Without the medium of the [celestial bodies], the influences of the superior [supercelestial] cannot be followed.

No one can do this, unless they return themselves to the intellect of the Sun and avoid that which is not similar, seeing the intellectual, and comprehending that intelligible light, as with the corporeal eye with sensible light.
