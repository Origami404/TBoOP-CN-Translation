    #emph[It is the noblest opinion of ancient magicians, illustrious Prince, that we must work for nothing more in this life [to ensure] that our noble minds degenerate very little, because we will come close to being endued with divine nature, lest vanity and leisure numb the mind to the fragility of our earthly bodies and loosen the sins of the flesh, ruined as if we were thrown down the dark precipice of our perverse lusts. Therefore, we should prepare our minds to be suitable for the most worthy and noble memories, always thinking, doing, and working something worthy for itself.]

    Chapter 1. Of the necessity, virtue, and usefulness of religion.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    It is now time that we turn to the highest part of magic, which teaches us how to understand and know the laws of religion,#t_footnote(<nt1900>, "nr1900")[1] how to gain truth from divine religion, and how we must duly 
develop our soul and mind. [It is by this] only that can we firmly comprehend the truth. Indeed, it is the common opinion of magicians that unless the mind and soul are well, the body cannot be well.#t_footnote(<nt1901>, "nr1901")[2] 
A man is truly healthy when the soul and body are thus connected and are agreeing with each other, since the firmness of mind and soul are not inferior to the strength of the body.#t_footnote(<nt1902>, "nr1902")[3] But, as Hermes said, we can obtain a firm and robust mind in no other way than from a life of integrity, with piety, and finally from divine religion.#t_footnote(<nt1903>, "nr1903")[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed, sacred religion purges the mind and restores the divine. It also helps nature and reinforces natural virtues, just as physicians help the health of the body and farmers help the virtues of the earth.#t_footnote(<nt1904>, "nr1904")[5] Whoever lays aside religious truths and only believes in the natural is often deceived by evil daemons.#t_footnote(<nt1905>, "nr1905")[6] However, [the practice of] scorning and curing sins, as well as the protection against evil daemons, is born from understanding religion.#t_footnote(<nt1906>, "nr1906")[7] Finally, nothing is more pleasing and welcome to God than a man who is perfectly pious and truly religious. [One who lives this way] excels as far over other men as the immortal gods are distant above him.#t_footnote(<nt1907>, "nr1907")[8]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, we must first purge ourselves and offer and commend ourselves to divine piety and religion.#t_footnote(<nt1908>, "nr1908")[9] Then, with our senses sleeping, [reject] that divine ambrosial nectar—nectar I say, referring to what the prophet Zechariah called the wine springing forth virgins#t_footnote(<nt1909>, "nr1909")[10]—a tranquil mind expecting, praising, and adoring that supercelestial Bacchus, the most supreme of gods and prelate of priests,#t_footnote(<nt1910>, "nr1910")[11] author of regeneration, who the ancient poets sang was twice born, from whom the most divine rivers flow into our hearts.

  ]
  #p_normal[
    Now, whatever you aspire to study of this science, you must cloak and constantly conceal with silence. Such a sacred doctrine [should be kept] within the inner sanctuary of your religious breast. Indeed, one who makes the fullest speeches of such divine majesty public to the awareness of the many, as Hermes said, has an irreligious mind.#t_footnote(<nt1911>, "nr1911")[1] The divine Plato taught that the sacred and secret in mysteries must not be divulged to the public.#t_footnote(<nt1912>, "nr1912")[2] Likewise, Pythagoras and Porphyry consecrated their followers with religious silence.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Also, of this, Orpheus—who initiated with sacred ceremonies—exacted oaths of silence with a certain terrible religious authority, lest religious secrets be heard by the profane.#t_footnote(<nt1913>, "nr1913")[3] From such practices it is sung in #emph[Of Sacred Words:]

  #p_poetry[
    #emph[“The goddess comes, away, go far away from here O profane,”]

    #emph[The priestess shouted, “withdraw entirely from this grove.”]

  #p_normal[
    Hence, only initiates were admitted into the sacred celebrations of Eleusinian Circe, with the acting herald shouting that the common profane must keep a distance.#t_footnote(<nt1915>, "nr1915")[5] We read of the same precept in Ezra. Hebrew kabbalistic secrets [are] referred to in the verses where he says: “Give these books to the wise of your people,”#t_footnote(<nt1916>, "nr1916")[6] [but only to those] “whose hearts you know can grasp and protect these secrets.”#t_footnote(<nt1917>, "nr1917")[7]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, the religious books of the Egyptians and those concerning secret ceremonies were made from hieratic papyrus—that is, sacred. In these, they wrote with unknown letters, which were also called sacred. We read Macrobius, Marcellinus, and others calling them hieroglyphics, [meaning] of course that writings of this kind should not be learned by the profane.#t_footnote(<nt1918>, "nr1918")[8] Indeed, Apuleius testified of this with these words: “With the sacrifice completed, certain books marked with unknown characters were brought from a concealed chamber. Some of these figures were animal conceptions suggesting sermons of compendious words, some were knots, and in the manner of wheels and ends like dense twisting tendrils to protect them from the curiosity of being read by the profane.”#t_footnote(<nt1919>, "nr1919")[9] Therefore, we must be silent and hide what is secret in religion if we are to be worthy students in this science.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed, the loyalty of silence, as Tertullian said, is owed to religion;#t_footnote(<nt1920>, "nr1920")[10] but to act otherwise is dangerous to those near. Apuleius said about sacred secrets: “I might speak if I am permitted to speak, you might understand if you are permitted to hear, but ears and tongue equally share the crime of idle curiosity.”#t_footnote(<nt1921>, "nr1921")[11]

  #p_normal[
    Thus, we read of Theodectes,#t_footnote(<nt1922>, "nr1922")[12] the tragic poet who was deprived of sight when, wishing to refer to a certain story, he wrote of mysteries in Jewish scripture. Likewise, Theopompus, who began to translate some divine law into the Greek tongue, was immediately struck with a certain disturbance of the mind and soul.#t_footnote(<nt1923>, "nr1923")[13] Afterward, his great begging touched God, who responded through an answer in a dream [that this occurred] because [Theopompus] 
polluted divine things by flattery in publishing them publicly. Indeed, a certain Numenius, curious of hidden things, offended the divinities because he divulged the sacred interpretation of the Eleusinian goddess. Indeed, he dreamed the Eleusinian goddess wore a courtesan’s clothes and was for sale in front of a brothel; and when he was surprised, she answered angrily that her chastity was attacked, stolen violently, and prostituted everywhere: because of this admonishment the ceremonies of the gods must not be divulged at all.#t_footnote(<nt1924>, "nr1924")[14]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, the ancients always studied God and nature by wrapping up the sacraments and concealing them with various puzzles, which is how the Indians, Brahmans, Ethiopians, Persians, and Egyptians observed laws. Hence, Hermes [Trismegistus], Orpheus, and all ancient prophets and philosophers—Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristoxenus, and Ammonius—loyally protected them as sacrosanct. Hence, Plotinus and Origen and other students of Ammonius, as told by Porphyry in his book
#emph[Of the Education and Teaching of Plotinus,] swore to not release the doctrines of their teacher. Because Plotinus violated his oath to Ammonius by publishing the sacraments, the penalty of his transgression—as some claim—was to be consumed as food by horrible lice. Also, Christ Himself—while He lived on the earth—spoke with that law and reasoning that only the private disciples will understand the mystery of the Word of God, while others will only perceive parables. Additionally, Christ warned to not give sacred things to dogs, nor cast pearls before swine.#t_footnote(<nt1925>, "nr1925")[15] Therefore, the prophet said: “I have hidden your words in my heart so that I will not sin against you.”

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, it is not fit that secrets that are communicated orally among only a few wise men be put together publicly in letters:#t_footnote(<nt1926>, "nr1926")[16] which is why, please pardon me, if I pass over many and the better secret sacraments of ceremonial magic in silence. But I think it is enough if I make known and refer to what is necessary. You will not depart from this book entirely empty of these mysteries. But on that condition [of secrecy], I will share these [words] with you, with which Dionysius bound Timothy—that is, that those who perceive these secrets will not expose them, but [rather they] will be collected among wise men and guarded with due respect.#t_footnote(<nt1927>, "nr1927")[17]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    I wish to also warn those of you beginning this [third volume of #emph[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]: just as the gods detest public and profane things and love the secret, it follows that all magical experiments flee the public and search for the concealed. [Magical experiments are] strengthened by silence but are destroyed by the visible, [and if made visible,] the effects will not be completed later. Indeed, all of these suffer loss when they are brought about by talkative and unbelieving minds. Therefore, a magical worker must—if they wish to gather this fruit—not reveal their secrets, work, place, time, desires, or purpose, unless to either a teacher, assistant, or associate who will also be faithful. [This person must also be] a believer, silent, and dignified by nature or tradition, since even a talkative, unbelieving, and indignant companion will impede and destroy the effectiveness of all operations.#t_footnote(<nt1928>, "nr1928")[18]

    Chapter 3. What dignification is required so that one can become a true magician and worker of wonders.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Near the beginning of the first book of this work, we spoke of what one must have to be a magician. However, we will now say a secret, necessary, and hidden thing for those who try to work in this art, which is the first, complement, and key to all magical operations: it is the dignification of men to this sublime virtue and power.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed, this ability requires a wonderful dignification in men. For that intellect which is in us, the highest mind of the soul is the only operator of wonders. When it is overwhelmed by the commerce of excessive flesh and occupied by the sensible soul of the body, it does not merit the command of divine substances. Thus, many who pursue this art are frustrated.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, we who struggle to attain such great heights must consider two chief things: The first method is that we should abandon carnal dispositions, tottering senses, and material passions. The second way and method by which we may ascend is with a pure intellect and joined with the virtues of the gods#t_footnote(<nt1929>, "nr1929")[1]—without which we cannot happily ascend to the inquiry of secret things and to the virtues of wonderful operations. Indeed, in these consist the entire dignification, which excels in nature, merit, and certain religious arts.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Natural dignity is the best disposition of the body and its organs, not obscuring the soul with any heaviness, nor anticipating any tumult or [imbalance in a particular] humor. This comes from the situation, motion, light, and influence of the celestial body and soul, which move about at each birth—for example, those whose ninth house is fortunate by Saturn, the Sun, and Mercury. Indeed, Mars in the ninth house also commands spirits. One can abundantly read about this in books of stars. However, for those who do not, it is necessary to compensate the defect of nature by education, optimal control, and the prosperous use of natural things, until which time one comes to complete inner and outer perfection.#t_footnote(<nt1930>, "nr1930")[2]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Hence, such great diligence of priests is stipulated in the Mosaic laws: [They prescribe] that he be undefiled by corpses, widows, or menstruating women. [They further stipulate] that he be free from leprosy, from flowing blood, and ruptures. [He must have] uninjured members. [He must] not [be] blind, nor lame, nor hunchbacked, and be without a deformed nose.#t_footnote(<nt1931>, "nr1931")[3] Apuleius said in his #emph[Apologia] that a boy about to be initiated for divination by magical spells must be selected healthy, unharmed, have natural abilities, beautiful, whole, a clever mind, and an eloquent mouth, so that in him is a divine power like a good temple, and the mind of the boy moves quickly, will be restored to his divinity.#t_footnote(<nt1932>, "nr1932")[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But two things—namely, learning and work—perfect meritorious dignity. The end of learning is to recognize the truth; therefore, one should—as was said around the beginning of the first book—be educated and expert in those three abilities. Then, with hindrances lifted, [one should] apply one’s soul to inner contemplation and turn oneself inward. Indeed, in us belongs the apprehension and power of all things, though we are hindered so that we enjoy these less because of passions#t_footnote(<nt1933>, "nr1933")[5] from our birth, by false imaginations, and immoderate appetites. When [these are] expelled, divine understanding and power enter.#t_footnote(<nt1934>, "nr1934")[6]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Religious operations obtain no fewer efficacies, which indeed often by themselves are effective for us to acquire a deifying virtue. Indeed, so great is the virtue of duly made and presented sacred operations— although not understood, yet piously and correctly observed and believed with a steadfast faith—that they have no less efficacy in adorning us with divine power.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, what dignity is acquired in religious art is perfected in certain religious ceremonies, expiations, consecrations, and sacred rites, whose spirit the public religion has consecrated.#t_footnote(<nt1935>, "nr1935")[7] They who have power in the laying on of hands and initiating with sacramental virtue—by which they impress the character of divine virtue and power, called divine consent, where a man is supported by divine nature—[acts] like a partner to heavenly effects, bearing the engrafted power by the divine will. These rites are related by the ecclesiastical sacraments.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, if you will be a perfect man [you must be] with a sacred religious mind, with great and constant religious piety; believing without hesitation; to whom sacred authority and nature have given dignity before others; whom the gods have condemned little; and by praying, consecrating, sacrificing, and invoking, [you] can attract spiritual and celestial virtues and can imprint onto those things whatever [you] wish and vivify all works by magical science. But whoever is beyond the authority of his office, without holiness or merit of education, is [therefore] beyond the dignity of nature and education [of those] who presume to some magical operation and will labor without profit. [Such a person] will deceive themselves and those who believe them and incur the dangerous anger of the gods.#t_footnote(<nt1936>, "nr1936")[8]

    Chapter 4. Of the two supports of ceremonial magic: religion and superstition.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    There are two things that rule all operations of ceremonial magic—namely, religion and superstition. Religion is a constant contemplation of the divine, pious operations, binding [oneself] with God and divine will by reverently serving those things worthy of veneration, devoting the cultivation of holiness, and exercising ceremonies cultivating the divine. Therefore, religion is a certain discipline of external sacred things and ceremonies, through which certain signs suggest internal and spiritual things. These are inserted by nature into us, as we are more rational than other animals.#t_footnote(<nt1937>, "nr1937")[1] Therefore, whoever neglects these and only believes in natural powers, as we have said above, are most often deceived by evil daemons.#t_footnote(<nt1938>, "nr1938")[2]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Thus, those who are most religious and holiest educated do not plant a tree, graft a vine, or undertake some small work without invoking the divine, as the teacher of the gentiles instructed the Colossians, saying: “Whatever you do in words or works, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to Him and God the Father through him.”#t_footnote(<nt1939>, "nr1939")[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, to add religious powers on top of physical and mathematical virtues is so far from fault that to not add them is a wicked crime; hence, in the #emph[Book of Senators,]#t_footnote(<nt1940>, "nr1940")[4] Rabbi Henina said: “Whoever has neglected a blessing when using some creature is believed by the church to have used it as a theft and robbery from God.” Of which it was written by Solomon: “Whoever has snatched something from the father or the mother, that man is a partner of the destroyer”;#t_footnote(<nt1941>, "nr1941")[5] but God is the father, and mother the church, as it is written: “Is it not he your father, who has possessed you?”#t_footnote(<nt1942>, "nr1942")[6] and elsewhere: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not dismiss the law of your mother.”#t_footnote(<nt1943>, "nr1943")[7]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Nothing displeases God more than to be neglected and scorned, but nothing pleases [God] more than veneration and adoration; hence, no creature in the world is permitted to be without religion.#t_footnote(<nt1944>, "nr1944")[8] Everything venerates God and everything prays, as Proclus said, singing hymns according to the orders of their leaders. However, some [pray] in a natural way, others sensible, others rational, indeed others intellectual,#t_footnote(<nt1945>, "nr1945")[9] but all bless God in their own way just as in the song of the three children.#t_footnote(<nt1946>, "nr1946")[10]
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Lactantius.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But religious rites and ceremonies have a diverse variety according to time and place, and each religion has something good because they are directed to God the creator.#t_footnote(<nt1947>, "nr1947")[11] Although God approves of only the Christian religion alone, other devotions accept His grace and are not entirely condemned. Even if they are not eternal, they are not left completely unrewarded and are given a temporary gift or are at least punished less. However, the impious and thoroughly irreligious are hated like enemies and are struck and exterminated. Indeed, impiety is greater than those who are deceived and follow erroneous religion. Indeed, no religion, as Lactantius said, is so erroneous that it does not [still] contain some wisdom and that can be pardoned if it holds [as a value] the highest service of man—if not in the things themselves, at least in intention.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Man himself is not able to reach true religion unless he is taught by God.#t_footnote(<nt1948>, "nr1948")[12] Therefore, all devotions that are alien to true religion are superstition, and all venerations that exhibit more [than is due] in divine devotion than true religion are also superstition.#t_footnote(<nt1949>, "nr1949")[13] Likewise, those that exhibit divine devotion either to what it must not be or in the way it must not be.#t_footnote(<nt1950>, "nr1950")[14] Therefore, be especially careful that at no time some perverse devotion of the highest superstition injures the all-powerful God and sacred divine powers under Him: indeed, this is both criminal and unbecoming of philosophers.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, superstitions—although alien from true religion—are not entirely or wholly condemned. Many are even tolerated and observed by protectors of religion. But I especially call superstition that which has a certain likeness to religion, to the extent that it imitates whatever is in religion: miracles, sacraments, rites, observations, and other things that obtain no less power from these. Also, no less power is obtained from the belief of the operator. Indeed, that much is possible from steadfast belief is discussed in the first book and is well known among the common people. Therefore, belief is required in superstition just as faith [is required] in religion.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Since such great things are possible with steadfast belief, miracles can even be performed from false opinions and operations. Indeed, anyone very firmly believing in the truth of his religion—even if it is false—elevates his spirit because of that belief. [Such a believer] becomes like those spirits who are the leaders and princes of that same religion and operate that which reason and nature do not discern. However, hesitant belief and disbelief in all works is not the way of superstition. It diminishes even true religion and invalidates the desired effect, even though the experiment might be very strong. But superstition imitates religion, as shown by the example of worms and locusts being driven away by bells and images when these are baptized so that [pests] will not harm fruit. There are many more examples of this sort.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, [concerning] ancient magicians and those who were authors of this art among the ancients—especially the Chaldeans, Egyptians, Assyrians, Persians, and Arabs, all of whose religions were perverse and soiled by idolatry—we must very much beware that we do not allow their errors to make war over the reason of our Catholic religion. Indeed, this is a blasphemy and subject to a curse, and therefore I would also be a blasphemer to this science if I did not admonish you.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, wherever you find things of this kind written by us, understand that foreign authors wrote them and they are not given to you by me as truth but by a conjecture that has an affinity to truth and an instruction for imitation of what is true in this. Therefore, we must collect truth from their errors, which will not work unless with profound intelligence, sound piety, hard and laborious diligence, and wisdom, by which one can know from every evil and can extract good, adapt everything twisted, and [restore] the correct use of those which it governs. Thus, of this, Augustine gave the example of carpentry, where oblique and bent instruments are no less necessary and suitable than the straight.#t_footnote(<nt1951>, "nr1951")[15]

    There are three guides that lead us to the path of truth and that govern all of religion, in which it entirely consists— namely, love, hope, and faith.#t_footnote(<nt1952>, "nr1952")[1] Indeed, love—the vehicle of the soul—is the most excellent of all, descending from the highest intelligences all the way to the lowest, gathering and turning our mind to divine beauty.#t_footnote(<nt1953>, "nr1953")[2] It likewise protects us in all of our operations and grants effects according to our wishes, supplying strength to our supplications.#t_footnote(<nt1954>, "nr1954")[3] Thus, we read from Homer that Apollo clearly heard the prayers of Chryses, because he was very much a friend to him.#t_footnote(<nt1955>, "nr1955")[4] [Similarly,] we read of Mary Magdalene in the Gospels: “Many sins were forgiven, because she loved much.”#t_footnote(<nt1956>, "nr1956")[5]

    However, hope immovably hangs on to those things that it desires when it is certain and unperturbed. It nourishes and perfects the mind, checking all that is good one by one. However, faith is the most superior of all virtues, inasmuch as it does not entirely depend on human studies but divine revelation.#t_footnote(<nt1957>, "nr1957")[6] It purifies everything through the whole world: for, since it descends from the highest first light and exists closest to it, it is by far nobler and more excellent than science, arts, and belief from inferior things.

    Indeed, faith is the root of all miracles. As the Platonists say, [it is] only by [faith that] we can approach God and gain divine protection and virtue.

However, no one can work by pure religion alone, unless they are made entirely intellectual. Whoever works with religion alone without the mixture of other virtues, if they persevere in the work for long, will be absorbed by the divine power and will not live long, and neither will anyone who attempts this be purified.

    Because all things exist and operate from the most supreme God, everything [first] depends upon the creator and then other divine powers, to whom is also given the authority to build and create. Indeed, [they are not given this authority] principally, but with the instrumental reason in the virtue of the First Creator, who is the beginning of all things and the first cause. What is produced by secondary causes may be more correctly said to be produced by the first, which has produced those causes. We, therefore, call those causes “secondary gods.” It is, therefore, necessary that each magician recognize that God, who is the producer and First Cause of all other gods and divine powers, which we call second causes, while at the same time they must not disregard those devotions to the secondary gods, providing sacrifices conforming to the condition of each.

    Therefore, whoever invokes the gods and does not follow them with their special honors nor duly distributes to each of them what is appropriate will not be chosen to gain their presence or their effects, just as in harmony—if one chord is broken—everything is suddenly dissonant.

    Indeed, the divine mind, by itself and from a single and uninterrupted act, without any intermediation or vicissitude, understands the highest good. He engenders in himself an offspring and the Son, who is a complete intelligence, a complete image of himself, and a complete exemplar of the world: which our John and Hermes named the “word” or “speech,” Plato “the Son of God the Father,” but Orpheus [called] him “Pallas,” who was born from the head of Jove—that is to say, wisdom. This is the most absolute image of the highest God the Father, but yet by a certain relation or something intrinsic, as it were, distinctly begat and generated.#t_footnote(<nt1987>, "nr1987")[4] As it said in #emph[Ecclesiastes]: “I came from the mouth of the most High, the firstborn before all creatures.”#t_footnote(<nt1988>, "nr1988")[5]

essence and substance, and entirely one simple nature. This is the Catholic

    The Father begat the Son from the eternal and gave him His substance but [also] retained it Himself.

    Likewise, this Son, although coeternal with the Father and born from the substance of the Father before the world, nevertheless was born into the world from the substance of a virgin and his name is Jesus: perfect God and perfect man, subsisting of a rational soul and human flesh, lacking nothing human except sin.

    God, although He is most singular, is appointed different names, which do not explain different essences or gods but certain qualities emanating from Him. Through these names, which are created, many and diverse blessings are given to us, as if they were distilled through certain channels. We described ten of these names above, which were also numerated by Jerome to Marcella. Then Dionysius collected 45 names of God the Father, and Christ. Hebrew mekubalim, from a certain text that is in Exodus, described 72 names of angels and God, which they call the name of 72 letters and Schemhamphoras#t_footnote(<nt2056>, "nr2056")[1]—that is, “Revealed.”#t_footnote(<nt2057>, "nr2057")[2] Others proceed further through each of the places of the scriptures, giving an indication of so many names of God, although as to what their numbers are and what they signify is thoroughly unknown to us.#t_footnote(<nt2058>, "nr2058")[3]

    Therefore, from these names, besides those that we have mentioned, is the name of the divine essence Eheie אהיה,#t_footnote(<nt2059>, "nr2059")[4] which Plato transposed as ὤν.#t_footnote(<nt2060>, "nr2060")[5] Hence they called God τὸ ὂν,#t_footnote(<nt2061>, "nr2061")[6] and others ὁ ὤν.#t_footnote(<nt2062>, "nr2062")[7] The other name is Hu הוא, which was revealed to Isaiah, indicating the divine abyss, which the Greeks translated as ταυτόν,#t_footnote(<nt2063>, "nr2063")[8] and the Latin “Himself.” And the other name is Esch אש, received by Moses, which means “fire,”   and the name of God Na נא , is to be invoked in disturbances and troubles. And also, the name Iah יה , the name Elion עליון , the name
Macom מקום , the name Caphu כפו, the name Innon יונן,#t_footnote(<nt2064>, "nr2064")[9] and the name Emeth אמת , mean “truth” and is the seal of God.

    And many names of God and angels were extracted from the sacred scriptures by kabbalistic, calculatory, notary, and gematrial arts, where certain letters from one name or many words were withdrawn and collected, or one name with each of its letters dispersed signifies or makes more.#t_footnote(<nt2066>, "nr2066")[11] But sometimes they are collected from the beginnings of words, such as the name Agla אגלא from this verse in the sacred scripture: אתה גיבר לעולם אדני—that is, “You are eternally strong, God.”
Likewise, the name Iaia יאיא from this verse:—יהוה אלהינו יהוה אחר
that is, “God, our God, is the one God.” Likewise, the name Iava יאוא
from this verse: יהי אור ויהי אור—that is, “Let there be light, and there
was light.” Likewise, the name Ararita אראריתא from this verse: “There
is one beginning of his unity, one beginning of his singularity, his change is one”#t_footnote(<nt2067>, "nr2067")[12] אחד ראש אחדותו ראש ייהודו תמורתו אחד . Another
name is Hacaba הקבה extracted from this verse:—הקדוש ברוך הוא
that is, “He is the holy and blessed one.” Likewise, the name Iesu ישו
is found in the beginnings of these two verses: יביא שלוהו לו—that is,
“Until the Messiah comes”;#t_footnote(<nt2068>, "nr2068")[13] and in the other: ינון שמו וית—that
is, “His name endures.”#t_footnote(<nt2069>, "nr2069")[14] Similarly, the name Amen אמן from this verse:
אדני מלך נאמן—that is, “The Lord, the faithful king.”

    Sometimes they extracted these names from the ends of words, such as the same name Amen from this verse: לא כן הרשעים : —that is, “Not so the wicked”—but the letters are transposed. Thus, in this final verse: 
לי מה שמו מה—that is, “Why me? What is his name?”—can be found the name of the Tetragrammaton. In all of these, a letter is placed for a speech and a letter extracted from a speech, or from the beginning, end, or wherever you wish.

    Sometimes these names are extracted from all of the letters one by one, just as those 72 names of God are extracted from those three verses of Exodus:

    Thus, sometimes a speech is extracted from a speech, or a word from
a word, by transposing letters (as Messiah משיח from Yismah ישמח and
Michael מיכאל from מלאכי Malachi), but sometimes by changing the
alphabet, which kabbalists call Ziruph צירוף (such as from the name
Tetragrammaton יהוה eliciting the names מצפצ Mazpaz, כוזו and
Kuzu). Sometimes names are also changed by the equalizing of numbers
(as Metatron מטטרון for Sadai שדי : indeed, each makes 314; for the

number: indeed, each makes 31.)#t_footnote(<nt2070>, "nr2070")[15]

    But, since barbarians (as Plato said in #emph[Cratylus]) had divine names that they had from God, without which we cannot grasp the true speeches and true names by which God is called, we can say nothing else about these, except that which God by his own kindness has revealed to us.#t_footnote(<nt2071>, "nr2071")[16] Indeed, they are the sacraments and vehicles of God’s omnipotence. These names do not come from men, nor indeed from angels. Rather, they are firmly instituted by the highest God Himself, who established them by way of the immovable numbers, which are inherent in certain characters and figures. They are exhaled from the divine harmony and consecrated with the assistance of the divine: whereby those that are superior fear them, the inferior tremble, the angels worship them, cacodaemons are frightened, and all creatures and all religions revere them.

    Religious observations and devotions give us a great advantage in our invocations. They deify the union and also cause wonderful supernatural works, effects, and power. Therefore, no one for any reason may change divine law.

As Plato said in 
#emph[Cratylus,] all divine words or names proceed originally from the gods, from antiquity, or from barbarians—the circumstances of their beginnings being not easily known.#t_footnote(<nt2073>, "nr2073")[18] Iamblichus likewise taught that they should not be translated from their language to another: “Indeed, names do not keep the same reason interpreted in another language.”

They have ears to hear, purified by faith, and by the most purified customs invocations of the divine, they are made a home for God and made capable for these divine influences.#t_footnote(<nt2078>, "nr2078")[23] Therefore, whosoever correctly uses these divine words or names with a purity of mind and manner, following those laws that were handed down to us, will both achieve and accomplish many wonders.#t_footnote(<nt2079>, "nr2079")[24] As we read from Medea:

    Although the highest Creator and First Cause rules and disposes all, He distributes the carrying out of tasks to various ministers of good and evil.

Of this, Augustine wrote in his book 
#emph[Questions:] “Each visible thing in this world has an angelic power placed in command of it.”#t_footnote(<nt2098>, "nr2098")[2] Thus Origen said in

Much more “are angels needed to be placed in charge of sacred works,” virtues, and men, as they always see the face of the highest God, gathering men and also the smallest together, and lead them to their rightful place, as well-ordered members of this world, in which God as a protector, most sweetly disposes all inhabiting it, not held or circumscribed, but containing all.#t_footnote(<nt2099>, "nr2099")[3] In Revelation, John described that heavenly city, whose twelve gates were guarded by twelve angels, influencing what they receive from a divine name of twelve revolutions.#t_footnote(<nt2100>, "nr2100")[4] In the foundation of that city are the names of the twelve apostles and the lamb.#t_footnote(<nt2101>, "nr2101")[5]

    Therefore, the heavens receive influences from the angels, but those are from the great name of God and Jesus, whose power is first in God, then diffused through those twelve and seven angels, by which they are extended into twelve signs and seven planets, and consequently into all other ministries and instruments of God, penetrating all the way to the lowest parts. Hence, Christ said: “He will grant to whoever asks in the name of my Father”; and the risen one once said: “In my name, they will cast out daemons.” The four-lettered name is no longer necessary for those who follow, because the entire virtue is translated in the name of Jesus, in which alone miracles are done—nor is there another name (as Peter said) under the heavens given to men that can save them except that one.

    But we cannot think that we can relate his name with a polluted mouth, just as the name of some man, and by that virtue make miracles possible. We must invoke it in the [name of the] Holy Ghost, with a cleansed mind and fervent soul, that we can gain from him that which is promised to us, especially foreknowledge, without which we cannot be heard according to that prophet: “I will clearly hear, because he knew my name.” Thus, today no favor can be drawn from the celestials unless the authority, favor, and assent of the name of Jesus intervenes. Thus, Hebrews and kabbalists, though they are skilled in divine names, cannot work with those ancient names in the way their forefathers once did, since the coming of Christ. Now, it is proved by experience that no evil daemon, and no inferior virtue [descending] from these, which can vex or possess men, can resist this name, but [kabbalists]

Not only should the “earthly, heavenly, and infernal genuflect,” but the insensible should also revere him, and at his nod, all tremble,#t_footnote(<nt2104>, "nr2104")[8] when the name of Jesus is pronounced from a faithful heart and a truthful mouth and innocent hands impress with the healing sign of the cross. Christ does not speak in vain to his disciples when he says: “In my name daemons are cast out,” unless certain 
virtues in His name are expressed over daemons and the ill, serpents and poisons and tongues and the like.

    We read in various places in the sacred scriptures of the various members and ornaments of God: but by members of God, they are understood as certain many-layered and simple powers that endure in God. They are distinguished from each other by the sacred names of God. However, the garments and ornaments of God are like certain ways, relations, emanations, or channels through which He diffuses Himself. As often as our minds touch the fringes of [these garments], divine powers also move forth to some member, just as Jesus cried out about the woman with flowing blood: “Someone has touched me: for I feel the strength pass from me.”#t_footnote(<nt2106>, "nr2106")[1]

    It is not only the opinion of poets and philosophers that the heavens and celestial bodies are animated with certain divine souls: it is also claimed by holy scriptures and by Catholics. Ecclesiastes describes heavenly souls, and Jerome expressly acknowledged the same.#t_footnote(<nt2158>, "nr2158")[1] Similarly, Origen, in his book #emph[On Principles,] wrote that he absolutely thought that the heavenly bodies are animated because they are said to take orders from God, which only conforms to a rational nature. Indeed, it is written: “I have enjoined a command on all of the stars.” As Job noted, even the stain of sin does not entirely separate the stars from accord. Indeed, we read: “The stars are likewise not pure in his sight,” which certainly does not refer to the brightness of the body.#t_footnote(<nt2159>, "nr2159")[2]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Eusebius Pamphilus in #emph[Theological Solutions]#t_footnote(<nt2160>, "nr2160")[3] and Augustine in #emph[Enchiridion] both thought that the celestial bodies are animated. More recently, Albertus Magnus also agreed in his book #emph[The Four Coequals,] as did Thomas Aquinas, in his book #emph[Of Spiritual Creatures,] and [Duns] Scotus in #emph[Upon the Sentences [of Lombard]]. To these the most learned man Cardinal Nicolaus Cusanus can be added.

    Augustine#t_footnote(<nt2161>, "nr2161")[4] himself overcame this in a strenuous discussion, in which he did not believe it was strange that the celestial bodies were worshipped with the veneration of the #emph[duliae] and their judgment and help implored. Thomas himself also assented to this, unless they are hindered by the opportunity of idolatrous rites. Plotinus added that they understand our prayers, and likewise clearly hear them.

    But if one wishes to entirely oppose this and take them as sacrilegious dogma, then listen to Augustine in

    We must now discuss intelligences, spirits, and daemons. An intelligence is an intelligible substance that is entirely free from the dense and putrefying mass of a body: immortal, insensible, defending everything.

I say “daemons” here and [do] not [refer to] those that are called devils, but rather to spirits that are called by the quality of the name—that is, knowing, intelligent, and wise.#t_footnote(<nt2163>, "nr2163")[1]

    However, according to the tradition of magicians, there are three kinds of these: The first are called supercelestial. Their minds are separated from their inner bodies, and are, as it were, intellectual spheres, honoring the one God as their firmest and most stable unity or center. For this reason, they now also call them gods because of a certain participation with divinity, because they are always filled by God and drink from the divine nectar.#t_footnote(<nt2164>, "nr2164")[2] They only live around the one God and do not preside over corporeal bodies, nor are adapted to the ministration of the more inferiors, but receive the light from God and infuse the more inferior orders, and they distribute single duties to each.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The celestial intelligences follow these in the second order, which are called worldly daemons—that is, applied beyond the divine worship of the worldly sphere—and which preside over the heavens and stars. From there, they are distributed into as many orders as there are heavens in the world and as many stars as there are in the sky. They called some Saturnine, which preside over the heaven of Saturn and over Saturn himself. Others [were termed] Jovian, who preside over the heaven of Jupiter and Jupiter himself. Similarly, they named various daemons on behalf of the other stars according to their names and virtues. Because ancient astrologers asserted that there are fifty-five motions,#t_footnote(<nt2165>, "nr2165")[3] they devised as many intelligences or daemons. They likewise placed in the starry heaven daemons who preside over signs, triplicities, decans, fivefold divisions,#t_footnote(<nt2166>, "nr2166")[4] degrees, and stars: for, even though the entire Peripatetic philosophical school assigned only one intelligence to each stellar orb, yet since each star and heaven has their own particular and different power and influence it is necessary that they have their own presiding intelligence that confers strength and action.

    Therefore, they placed twelve princes of daemons who preside over the twelve signs of the zodiac,#t_footnote(<nt2167>, "nr2167")[5] thirty-six who preside over as many decans, seventy-two who preside over as many as fivefold divisions#t_footnote(<nt2168>, "nr2168")[6] of the heavens and tongues of men and nations, four who preside over the triplicities and elements, and seven governors of the whole world according to the seven planets. They placed names and signs over all of them, which are called characters, and used them in their invocations, incantations, and sculptures. They described them in their instruments for operations, images, plates, mirrors, rings, papers, candles, and the like.#t_footnote(<nt2169>, "nr2169")[7] For instance, when they operated for the Sun, they invoked by the name of the Sun and the name of the Solar daemon, and so on for the rest.

  #p_normal[
    Third, they placed daemons as ministers for disposing those things that are more inferior. [These are the things] that Origen called “certain invisible virtues,” which are believed to be disposed upon the earth.#t_footnote(<nt2170>, "nr2170")[8] Indeed, being visible to no one, they often direct our various journeys and business and take part in battles. As it is said they can cause prosperity, they naturally help their chosen friends achieve success in secret and inflict adversity as they please.#t_footnote(<nt2171>, "nr2171")[9]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    In a similar way, they distributed these into more orders: for instance, some are fiery, some watery, some airy, and some earthy. Indeed, they counted four kinds of daemons according to the virtues of the celestial souls—namely, mind, reason, imagination, and the vivifying and moving natures. Hence, the fiery follow the mind of the celestial souls, from where they agree to the contemplation of the more sublime. The airy [daemons] follow and favor the rational powers, and they separate the sensual from the vegetable in a certain way. Airy [daemons] serve [those people who lead] active lives, just as fire [serves] the contemplative.#t_footnote(<nt2172>, "nr2172")[10] The watery follow imagination and sense, serving the delightful life; earthy follow nature, favoring the vegetable nature.#t_footnote(<nt2173>, "nr2173")[11] In addition, they also distinguished these kinds of daemons as Saturnine and Jovian according to the names of the stars and heavens. Others are eastern, western, southern, and northern.#t_footnote(<nt2174>, "nr2174")[12]

    Finally, there is no part of the world deserted of the individual assistance of these daemons,#t_footnote(<nt2175>, "nr2175")[13] not because they are alone but because they especially rule [that particular place].

    However, these should not be understood as if they are subject to the influences of the stars.

Thus, these daemons are fitted to various stars, places, and times—not because they are confined to a time or place (just as they are not [confined] to bodies they preside in) but because the order of prudence has decided it. Therefore, they favor and protect those bodies, places, times, and stars more. Thus, they call some diurnal, others nocturnal, and others meridional.#t_footnote(<nt2177>, "nr2177")[15]

    In a similar way, some are called wooded, others mountainous, others rural, and others household.

    Thus, some of these are very close and familiar with men. They are also affected by human disturbances, and Plato thought men did wonderful [arts of] magic by these instructions, just as by men’s instruction some beasts that are very close to us, such as apes, dogs, and elephants, often do wonderful things above their species.#t_footnote(<nt2178>, "nr2178")[16] The Danes and Norwegians have written of these things, testifying about various kinds of daemons in those regions who were subjected to the slavery of men.#t_footnote(<nt2179>, "nr2179")[17]

    Additionally, some daemons are corporeal and mortal. Their bodies beget and perish yet live to a great age, which was the belief of the Egyptians and Platonists and was especially approved by Proclus. Likewise, the philosophers Plutarch, Demetrius, and the rhetorician Aemilianus also confirmed [that some daemons have mortal bodies]. Indeed, they testified of many prodigies in their time where the great daemon Pan and many other [daemons] first began wailing, and then died.#t_footnote(<nt2180>, "nr2180")[18]

    Therefore, it is the Platonic opinion that the third kind of daemon is of this [mortal variety]. [The Platonists assert] that there are as many legions [of daemons] as there are stars, and likewise there are as many stars encircling the sky as there are daemons in any legion.#t_footnote(<nt2181>, "nr2181")[19] The true number of good daemons, as related by Athanasius, is ninetynine parts to the number of men, which was compared to the parable of the hundred sheep. Others think there are only nine parts according to the parable of the ten drachmas. Others think that the number of angels is equal to that of men, because the scripture says: “God set up the bounds of the people according to the number of angels.”

Some theologians assert that they received [knowledge of this] by prophecies.#t_footnote(<nt2184>, "nr2184")[22]

    Under these [unclean spirits], they placed a sort of subterranean or dark daemon, which Platonists called “deserted angels” and “avengers of wickedness and impiety.” [This is] just as there are [avengers] of justice and divine law.#t_footnote(<nt2185>, "nr2185")[23] [These “deserted angels”] are also called “evil daemons” and “wicked spirits,” because they often strike and do harm. [The Platonists] also reckon many legions of these kinds of [evil] daemons, similarly distinguishing [those beings] according to the names of the stars, elements, and parts of the world, naming them and placing kings, princes, and guards for them.

    Presiding over these are four most harmful kings according to the four parts of the world. Under these are many more ruling princes of the legions, and also many private offices; hence the Gorgons, Statenoctae, and Furies; hence Ctesiphone, Alecto, Megera, and Cerberus. Porphyry said these kinds of daemons [they] “dwell in a place near the earth, indeed within the earth itself.” There is no evil that they dare not perpetrate. They have entirely violent and evil customs, and therefore devise and construct many violent and sudden snares. Conducting incursions, they often lie hidden.

    [Our theologians] placed lowest in this hierarchy the Principalities, Archangels, and Angels. Indeed, Iamblichus enumerated the order of the cosmos in the same way.

The first[— Principalities—]look after the public, princes, magistrates, provinces, and each and every kingdom.#t_footnote(<nt2188>, "nr2188")[2] We read [of the Principalities] in Daniel, where it is written: “the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me for twenty-two days.” Jesus, the son of Sirach, testified that each nation has a guiding angel placed in command of it.#t_footnote(<nt2189>, "nr2189")[3] Moses seemed to indicate this in his song in Deuteronomy, saying: “Since the Most High divided the nations, setting up boundaries according to the number of the angels of God.”#t_footnote(<nt2190>, "nr2190")[4]

    The second of these [celestial beings—that is, Archangels—]are concerned with the sacred.

    Also, Basil the Great spoke of not only the bodies of daemons but also angels as [having the form of] thin, airy, and pure spirits.#t_footnote(<nt2264>, "nr2264")[4] Gregory of Nazianzus also agreed with this.#t_footnote(<nt2265>, "nr2265")[5] Apuleius thought that not all daemons have bodies; accordingly, in the book

    Although [the body of a daemon] is a spiritual body, it is capable of great sensation and can be touched.

    Of this Calcidius said: “Ethereal and airy daemons, because their bodies do not have enough fire so that they are evident, nor do they have enough earth so that their solidity resists touch, that their entirety is bound by the serene ether and fluidity of air, joined by an imperishable surface. The other daemons are not always as plausible, disagreeable, or invisible, sometimes visible, changing into different figures. They clothe themselves in shadows and bloodless phantoms, drawing the filth of a dense body, and they especially associate with the forest (which the ancients called “malignant souls”) and from their affinity with the earth and water, they derive pleasure and lust.”#t_footnote(<nt2273>, "nr2273")[13] Of these kinds are lamiae, incubi, and succubi.

    Yet no daemon (as Marcus believed) can be thought of as male or female since these sexes relate to composed [bodies], but the bodies of daemons are simple. Although all of the fiery and airy daemons have the ability to change their form easily to what their imagination conceives, not all daemons can make themselves into any figure they wish. Dark subterranean daemons, because their imagination is contained in the difficulties of a thick and sluggish body, cannot bring about different figures as the others can. The watery, who live on the moist surfaces of the earth, are much like the demented softness of women, of which kind are Naiads and Dryads. However, those who live in arid and dry places produce dryer masculine bodies, such as satyrs, onocentaurs#t_footnote(<nt2274>, "nr2274")[14] (with legs like an ass), fauns, sylvans, and incubi.

    It is the common opinion of theologians that the essential nature of evil daemons is to equally hate gods and men.#t_footnote(<nt2276>, "nr2276")[1] Therefore, divine providence has placed the purest daemons in charge close to us, who are entrusted to us as shepherds or guides, that they may help us daily and ward off evil daemons, blocking and binding them so that they cannot hurt us as much as they wish. Thus, we read in Tobias that Raphael apprehended the daemon named Asmodeus and banished him to the desert in Upper Egypt.#t_footnote(<nt2277>, "nr2277")[2]

    Of this, Hesiod said: “Jove has 30,000 spirits living on the earth guarding mortal men, who certainly watch justices and merciful deeds, clothed in air, moving everywhere on the earth.”#t_footnote(<nt2278>, "nr2278")[3] Indeed, there is no prince, no great man, who continues unharmed; nor any woman remaining uncorrupted; nor does any man in this valley of ignorance come to his end appointed by God, if good daemons nearby did not protect us, or if evil daemons were permitted to satisfy the evil wishes of men.#t_footnote(<nt2279>, "nr2279")[4]

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, just as good daemons are individually appointed to stand guard to strengthen each man to the spirit of good, thus an evil [daemon] is sent as an enemy, presiding over their flesh and desires, and the good protector fights for us for our spirit against the enemy and the flesh. But man, between this fighting, is in the middle. [Man is] left in the hand of his own counsel and will give the victory to whom he wishes.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, we cannot reprimand the angels if they do not bring those nations who do not believe in the knowledge of the true God to true piety and religion and allow these people to fall into erroneous and perverse worship. It is to be ascribed to those who by their own will turn aside from the right path, adhering to the spirits of error, and give victory to the devil. Indeed, it is in the hand of man to adhere to whom he wishes, conquer whom he wishes, “from whom, if once the enemy daemon is overcome, is made his servant” and being conquered, another is unable to attack, like a wasp that has lost its sting. Origen also supported this opinion in his book #emph[Periarchon]#t_footnote(<nt2280>, "nr2280")[5] and concluded that the saints reduced the army of evil daemons when they fought back against them and conquered them. [These daemons] cannot disturb others anymore, or conquer those with the divine truth.

    Therefore, just as each man is given a good spirit, thus also he has been given a diabolical evil spirit. Each [personal spirit of evil] seeks a union with our spirit. It strives to attract [our spirit] to itself and intermingle with it like wine with water. Indeed, the good conform themselves with good works and change us to unite with angels, as is written in Malachi of John the Baptist: “Behold I send my angel before your face.” Of change and union it is written elsewhere: “he who adheres with God, his spirit is united with Him.”#t_footnote(<nt2281>, "nr2281")[6]

Thus [the soul] bears wonderful things, but whether [they are good or bad depends upon] the duties the daemon [is given to carry out].#t_footnote(<nt2283>, "nr2283")[8] Indeed, a good daemon—when influencing a holy soul—raises it to the light of wisdom. An evil daemon—transferred into a perverse soul—inspires theft, murder, desires, and whatever the duties of the evil daemon are into [the human in question.]#t_footnote(<nt2284>, "nr2284")[9] Good daemons (as Iamblichus said) most perfectly purge souls. Some also give other things to us, and being present, they give health to the body, strengthen the soul, secure the mind, take away what is deadly to us, favor heat, and deliver what is effective for life, and by a harmony, always infuse light into an intelligible mind.#t_footnote(<nt2285>, "nr2285")[10]

Yet the one subject perceives a certain presiding yoke, from which they cannot easily free themselves; indeed, they fear and revere that power, which the more superior angels flow to the more superiors, and with a certain terror, they induce a presiding fear into the more inferiors.#t_footnote(<nt2288>, "nr2288")[13] Homer seemed to perceive this when he said that the Muses gave birth to Jove and Jove begat kings, and they are always inseparable comrades.

    But the daemon of the nativity, which is called the genius, descends from the disposition of the world and circuit of the stars that were situated in the birth. Some suppose that when the soul descends into the body it naturally selects a guardian for itself from the chorus of daemons. [This choice is] not so much the choosing of a leader as of a protector. This executor and guardian of life unites, joins, and cares for the body and helps a man according to his duty that celestials appointed at birth.#t_footnote(<nt2307>, "nr2307")[5] Therefore, whoever receives a fortunate genius becomes virtuous, effective, strong, and prosperous in their works.

This daemon changes when the profession is changed, then, according to the 
dignity of the profession, the daemon helps our profession be more dignified and more sublime. It successively cares for the man and is different from day to day as he compares himself to the guardian of the profession as [the man] rises from virtue to virtue. Therefore, when the profession agrees with our nature, and there is a daemon of our profession near us that is like us and agrees with our genius, it makes our life more tranquil, happy, and prosperous. However, when we enter a profession unlike or contrary to our genius, our life becomes laborious, discordant, and troublesome to patrons.

    How angels speak is as hidden to us as they are; but for our own speech a tongue is necessary, along with other instruments: the pharynx, palate, lips, teeth, throat, lungs, windpipe, and breast muscles (which have the beginning of the motion of the soul). If one would speak to another from a distance, they need to shout more vehemently, just as if close by, he whispers in the ear. If joined with the listener, a tighter breath is possible, for he would not need to slide to the listener to speak, but [would communicate] with no noise, as an image in the eye or a mirror. As the soul leaves the body, angels and daemons thus speak. What man does with a sensible voice, they do by impressing the conception of the conversation into those to whom they speak, which is a better way than if they spoke with an audible voice.#t_footnote(<nt2313>, "nr2313")[1]

Indeed, the more secret theologians say that these rule everything by a certain changing of the hours, days, and years. [This is] just as the astrologers teach of the of the rulerships of the planets. Therefore, Hermes Trismegistus called these the seven “governors of the world,” where they are distributed to these more inferiors through the heavens as if with instruments, by gathering all of the influences of the stars and signs.#t_footnote(<nt2321>, "nr2321")[5] There are those who appoint somewhat different names, saying that over Saturn presides an intelligence named Ophiel, Jupiter Zachariel, Mars Zamael, the Sun Michael, Venus Anael, Mercury Raphael, and the Moon Gabriel. Each of these governs the world for 354 years and 4 months, and the rulership begins with the intelligence of Saturn, after which, in order, the intelligence of Venus rules, then Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, the Moon, and the Sun, and then they return command to Saturn.

    Chapter 26. Of finding the names of spirits and geniuses from the disposition of the celestial bodies.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Ancient magicians taught the art 
of finding the names of spirits for some desired effect, by extracting them from 
the disposition of the celestials. For example, [consider] some celestial 
harmony proposed to you for making an image, ring, or another undertaking under a certain celestial.#t_footnote(<nt2341>, "nr2341")[1] If you wish to find the spirit guiding that work, erect a celestial figure and place the letters in their number and order from the degree of the ascendant according to the succession of signs by each degree, completing the entire circle of heaven. Then those letters that fall in a place of stars, according to the number and fortitude of the same stars, mark these in number and order, constituting the name of the spirit—that is, the good. However, if you make these starting on the west#t_footnote(<nt2342>, "nr2342")[2] against the progressions of the signs, the result will be an evil kind.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Several Hebrew and Chaldean teachers teach that the nature and name of each man’s genius can be found with that art, such as knowing the degree of the ascendant of anyone’s nativity and weighing the other angles of heaven. Then which planets that are in those four angles that have more dignities (which the Arabs call #emph[almutez])#t_footnote(<nt2343>, "nr2343")[3] be noted first among the rest, and according to that second place, which is next to it in the number of dignities, and thus the rest by that order, which holds any dignity in the preceding angles. By using this order, you will know the true place and degree of them in heaven, and beginning from the degree of the ascendant, place the twenty-two Hebrew letters on each degree according to the order of signs. Then those letters that fall in the preceding place of the stars, note and dispose them according to the order [mentioned] above that were found in the stars, and correctly combine them according to the rationale of the Hebrew tongue, make the name of the genius.#t_footnote(<nt2344>, "nr2344")[4] According to custom, some monosyllabic name of divine omnipotence, for example, El or Iah, is joined to the end. If the letters are placed by the angle of the west#t_footnote(<nt2345>, "nr2345")[5] and against the succession of signs, and the letters which fall in the nadir—that is, the opposite point—the aforesaid stars are joined in order as we have said and make the name of the evil genius.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, the Chaldeans proceed in another way. Indeed, they do not take the #emph[almutez] of the angles, but rather the #emph[almutez] of the eleventh house, and they make it through all as has been said; but they acquire the evil genius from the angle of the #emph[almutez] of the twelfth house, which they call the evil daemon, casting from the degree of the west against the progression of the signs.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Also, most Arabs and several Hebrews acquire the name of the genius from the five hylegical places,#t_footnote(<nt2346>, "nr2346")[6] always projecting them from the beginning of Aries, and finding the letters according to hylegical order understood by astrologers, reducing and joining them in order, making the name of good genius. But the name of the evil genius is extracted from the places opposite the hylegical places and projected from the last degree of Pisces against the order of signs.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, others do not use the hylegical places but instead take the place of the
#emph[almutez] over the five hylegical places, projecting it from the horoscope,#t_footnote(<nt2347>, "nr2347")[7] as previously said.

  #p_normal[
    And these names, thus according to the proportional numbers distributed by the starry calculator, compacted by joined and alternating letters, although with unknown sounds and significations, it is necessary to confess that the secret principal philosophies can do more in a magical work than significative names.#t_footnote(<nt2348>, "nr2348")[8] While the intellect is astonished by those puzzles and the intent of the stretching of the mind, firmly believing that something divine is under it, these words and names, although not understood, reverently pronounce the glory of the divine, captivating oneself in spiritual piety in obedience of Him.

  #p_normal[
    There is yet another art to these kinds of names that they call calculatory, which is done by following tables by entering some sacred, divine, or angelic name in the descending column of letters and then taking those letters that are found in common 
angles under their stars and signs. When reduced in order, they constitute the 
name of the good spirit from the nature of those stars and signs, under which it 
was entered. If they are made in the ascending column of letters, taking the common angles above the stars and signs marked in the lower line, it constitutes the name of the evil spirit. And these are the names of spirits from any order or heaven ministering good as well as evil, which, according to this method, you can multiply nine names in as many orders, inasmuch as with entering one name, you can extract another spirit of a superior order from the same place, good as well as evil.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Yet the beginning of this calculation depends on the names of God. Indeed, every voice has a virtue in magic since it depends on the voice of God and is thus formed.#t_footnote(<nt2349>, "nr2349")[1] Therefore we must know that all angelic names must proceed from some distinguished name of God, and therefore angels are said to carry the name of God, which, according to the scripture: “Because my name is in Him.”
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore as the names of good angels can be discerned from the names of evil, one can often join some name of divine omnipotence to the end, such as El, On, Iah, or Iod, and be pronounced with it.#t_footnote(<nt2350>, "nr2350")[2] And, because Iah is the name of beneficence, and Iod is the name of a deity, therefore these two names are only appointed to names of angels. However, the name El, because it brings about power and virtue, can, therefore, be added to not only good but also evil spirits. Indeed, even evil spirits cannot subsist or act somewhat without the virtue of God.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    We must know that other [names] must be taken from common angles of the same 
stars and signs unless entering a mixed name, just as the names of geniuses are, 
which are spoken about in the previous chapter. They are composed by the 
disposition of heaven according to the diverse harmony of the stars; indeed, as 
often as the table is entered with these, the common angle is taken under the 
star or sign of the letter entered.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Additionally, there are those who extend these tables, so that they may also observe if the name of some desired star, office, or effect is entered, the good and evil daemon serving that office or effect is extracted. In a similar way, when the individual name of any person is entered, they believe that the name of the genius under that star that can be seen is placed in charge of such a person—such as [can be recognized] from their physiognomy, from the passions and inclinations of their mind, or from their profession and fortune—and recognize them to be Martial, Saturnine, Solar, or the nature of another star.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    And although from their own significations, these kinds of distinguished names have little or no power, these kinds of extracted names and those derived from them are yet greatly effective, just as the rays of the Sun collected in the hollow of a mirror burn the strongest, yet the Sun itself is scarcely moderately warm.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But there is an order of the letters in these tables under the stars and signs, similar to that of the astrologers’ order of decans, novenaria, and duodecima.#t_footnote(<nt2351>, "nr2351")[3] Alfonsus Cyprius#t_footnote(<nt2352>, "nr2352")[4] once wrote of these calculatory arts, and I do not know if someone else has adapted this to Latin characters. However, as the letters of each language (as we have shown in the first book) have their number, order, celestial figure, and divine origin, I will easily concede that the names of these spirits can be calculated not only in Hebrew letters but also by Chaldean, Arabic, Egyptian, Greek, Latin, and whatever else there is, the tables of those being rightly made in imitation of the preceding.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Many object to this, but it turns out that with these tables, many men of different natures and fortunes, because of the sameness of their name, often obtain the same genius of the same name. Therefore, we must know (and must not think it absurd) that the same daemon can be separate from many souls and then can lead many. In addition, as different men often have the same name, thus also spirits of different offices and natures can have one name and be noted with one sign or character, yet regarded as different: for, as the serpent at one time is a figure for Christ and another time the devil, thus likewise the same sign is at one time equal in order to some evil daemon, at another time to some good angel. Finally, the ardent intention of the invoker, by which our intellect is joined to a separate intellect, make it that at one time we have one spirit, and at other times another yielding to us, although invoked under that name.

    However, because, as we have said above, all spirits, whether good or evil, search for a union with men, whom they also often overtake in a certain way (as in the holy scriptures we read of several men called gods, angels, and daemons). Indeed, the names of those who are endowed with some singular excellent virtue, or a persistent or obstinate incurable wickedness after leaving this world, have obtained a place among the names of good or evil daemons and are numbered with them, whether we think they signify the souls of those men or their good or evil geniuses.

Precious stones that were sculpted and consecrated were placed before them. One of these stones [thus placed] had the power to restore sight to the blind, and no fire could destroy any of them.

    Now we must discuss the characters and seals of spirits. Characters are nothing else than certain unknown letters and writings, guarding the holy#t_footnote(<nt2372>, "nr2372")[1] names of the gods and spirits from the use and reading by the profane. Ancients called these “hieroglyphics,” meaning “sacred letters,” because they were only devoted to the sacred gods. Accordingly, they considered it a sin to write the mysteries of the sacred gods with the [same] characters with which the profane, indecent, and common people wrote.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Porphyry said the ancients wished to conceal God and divine virtues by sensible figures, and by those [figures] that are visible, [they] signify the invisible. Sacred letters teach great mysteries and explain certain symbolic figures. For example, they declared all spherical and round things [to correspond with] with the world, the Sun, the Moon, hope, fortune, and the concept of a circle to heaven, but parts of a circle are for the Moon. Pyramids and obelisks are assigned to fire and the gods of Olympus. Cylinders related to the Sun and earth. The shape of a penis refers to generation and to Juno, and the triangle accordingly is said to indicate the feminine sex.#t_footnote(<nt2373>, "nr2373")[2]

    These kinds of characters have no other root than the choice and authority of the builder—those, I say, who have received the power of building and consecrating these kinds of letters. Sacred priests who were from diverse nations and many religious sects made these, and their traditions do not come to us, except for a few certain scatterings or fragments that authors delivered to us. Therefore, some these kinds of characters are those noted by Peter de Abano, which were handed down by Honorius of Thebes, whose figures are thus related to our alphabet:#t_footnote(<nt2374>, "nr2374")[3]

    Chapter 30. Another method of characters from the kabbalistic tradition.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    I have found more methods of characters among the Hebrews, of which one is most ancient—namely, an ancient writing that Moses and the prophets used, whose form is not rashly revealed. Indeed, those letters were set up by Ezra and are still used today. There is also a writing among them called “celestial,” which is shown by the arrangement and figures of the stars, not unlike how astrologers draw images of the signs by the lines of stars. There are also those writings called Malachim or Melachim—that is, “of angels” or “royal”—and there is another called “the passage of the rivers.” And here are all of the characters and figures:#t_footnote(<nt2375>, "nr2375")[1]

  #p_normal[
    There is another kind among kabbalists. It once had great veneration but today is used so commonly that it is almost found placed among the profane. It is thus: the twenty-seven Hebrew letters are divided into three classes,#t_footnote(<nt2376>, "nr2376")[2] 
of which each contains nine letters—namely, the first, א ב ג ד ה ו ז ח ט, which are the signs of simple numbers and of intellectual things distributed into nine orders of angels. The second [class] has 
י כ ל מ נ ס ע פ צ, signs of ten and heavenly things in the nine orbs of heaven.#t_footnote(<nt2377>, "nr2377")[3] However, the third [class] has the remaining four letters, with the five finals by order—namely, 
ק ר ש ת ך ם ן ף ץ, signs of hundreds and inferior things; that is, the four simple elements and five kinds of perfect compositions.#t_footnote(<nt2378>, "nr2378")[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    They then distribute these three classes into nine vaults, of which the first is three ones—that is, intellectual, heavenly, and elemental—the second is of twos, and the third is of threes and thus the rest. The vaults are formed by the intersection of four parallel lines, intersecting themselves in right angles, thus shown in the following figure: #t_img("./images/00176.jpeg")
  ]
  #p_normal[
    And if those parts are cut apart, they make nine particular figures, thus: #t_img("./images/00177.jpeg")
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The notaricon written above are the nine vaults characterizing their letters. 
If there is one point [on a given letter], [this] indicates the first letter of that vault. If two points, this indicates the second vault. If three, it refers to the third. As an example, if you wish to form the characters of Michael, מיכאל, they are entered thus and extended into five characters, thus: #t_img("./images/00178.jpeg")
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Which are then drawn together into three figures in this manner: #t_img("./images/00179.jpeg")
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Then these are collected into one (yet the points of the notaricon are often omitted). Therefore, the character of Michael results thus:#t_footnote(<nt2379>, "nr2379")[5]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    #t_img("./images/00180.jpeg")
  ]
  #p_normal[
    And there is still another method of characters, which is common to almost all letters and tongues and is a very easy method, which is by collecting letters. For instance, if you are given the name of the angel Michael, those characters are formed thus: #t_img("./images/00181.jpeg")
  ]
  #p_normal[
    This method is most received by the Arabs; nor is there any writing that is so willingly and elegantly joined to itself as Arabic.

  #p_normal[
    Moreover, you must know that angelic spirits, since they are a pure intellect and are entirely incorporeal, are not derived from signs, characters, paintable 
figures, or human command. We, [though] ignorant of their essence and quality, 
devote and consecrate the characters of those figures and seals from those 
names, works, or other things because of our dispositions—by which we cannot in 
any way compel those spirits to us. [However,] by these [figures] we can rise to 
them, inasmuch as from these kinds of unknown characters and figures, we can 
gather first by our inner senses as well as outer senses. Then by a certain 
admiration of our reason, we are brought to a religious veneration to them. Then 
the entire mind is seized into an ecstatic adoration, and with a wonderful faith, an infallible hope, and a vivifying love, we can invoke them in spirit and truth with their true names and characters and ask that we receive their virtue.

    Chapter 31. Yet another method of characters and seals of spirits, which are only received by revelation.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    There is another kind of character, which is only received by revelation and cannot be found in any other way. The virtues of these characters written in secret seals are divinely revealed, breathing the harmony of some divinity. [These seals] are like a treaty or pact taken in league between us and them.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Of this kind is a seal shown to Constantine, which most call a cross. In Latin letters the words “IN HOC VINCE”#t_footnote(<nt2380>, "nr2380")[1] were written upon it. Another such seal was revealed to Antiochus, with the surname Soteris, in the figure of a pentagram. This proclaimed health (for if resolved into letters proclaims the word ὑγίεια#t_footnote(<nt2381>, "nr2381")[2]—namely, “HEALTH”). With these signs in faith and virtue, each king reported a great victory against their enemies. Thus, Judas received the noble seal מׄכבׄיׄ from an angel, and for that reason was later surnamed Maccabeus, and he fought with the Jews against Antiochus Eupator in virtue of which he first slew 14,000 with a huge number of elephants, then another 35,000 enemies. Indeed, that sign was representative of the four-lettered name and the letters of the seventy-two names through the memorable symbol of the number and is shown thus: 
מי כמוך באלים יהוה—namely, “Which of you is as strong as the Tetragrammaton.”#t_footnote(<nt2382>, "nr2382")[3] Therefore the figures of these three memorable seals must be formed thus: #t_img("./images/00182.jpeg")
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Additionally, Porphyry said in his book #emph[Of Answers] of these seals and characters that the characters and figures that signify the gods with which they can rejoice, be summoned, be offered to them, and what their figures of likenesses should be, were shown through the oracle of Proserpina. He also said that Hecate taught how likenesses should be set up for her and that they should be surrounded with wormwood, and painted with [images of] house mice, and with beautiful ornaments that were most pleasing to her soul, and as [with] many mice as her forms were to be taken, blood, myrrh, storax, and other things were burned. If this were done, she would appear to the operator in dreams and answer.#t_footnote(<nt2383>, "nr2383")[4] But we will show the oracle of Hecate, indeed saying thus: #emph[Hecate’s likeness and how sacred pacts are made to her.]

    Of such kind were the former secret mysteries of the gods and daemons of the pagans,#t_footnote(<nt2385>, "nr2385")[6] which they persuaded themselves that men could collect, detain, and bind. Hence, Iamblichus and Porphyry taught that if one invokes holy daemons, they must follow each with their particular honor and assign each their appropriate grace, offerings, gifts, sacrifices, words, characters, and the like, which are harmonious to their condition. Otherwise, they will never obtain the presence of divinities or daemons and desired effects. When invoked they will attempt to harm, especially those who do these things negligently.#t_footnote(<nt2386>, "nr2386")[7]

    Chapter 32. How we can draw good daemons to us, and how we can conquer evil daemons.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The effects of religion are obtained through the effects of daemons. Indeed, no work of wonderful efficacy can be made in religion unless some good daemon nearby guides and satisfies that work. But good daemons, even if we draw them in different ways, are not chained—nor can they be bound by us.#super[1] They can only be implored by certain sacred things.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[How daemons must be implored.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    For instance, from Apuleius we read [of them being implored] “by the heavenly stars, by the infernal divine powers, by the natural elements, by the nocturnal silences, by the sanctuaries of Coptos,#t_footnote(<nt2387>, "nr2387")[2] by the increase of the Nile and the secrets of Memphis and the sistrums of Pharos.”#t_footnote(<nt2388>, "nr2388")[3] Elsewhere, Porphyry [addresses these daemons, calling them], “You, who have risen from the mud, who sit in [your] place,#t_footnote(<nt2389>, "nr2389")[4] who sail in ships, who change your form in each hour, and change in each zodiacal sign.”#t_footnote(<nt2390>, "nr2390")[5]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    By these and these kinds of symbolic orations and hymns, because they are signs of divine virtues, daemons sometimes apply themselves to human uses, not because they are forced by some necessity, but voluntarily. By a certain custom, they easily approach those who conquer them by prayers of invocation. According to Porphyry in his book #emph[On Answers,] Hecate said:
  ]
  #p_poetry[
    #emph[I come to you persuaded by your prayers.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Elsewhere in the same book it is said:
  ]
  #p_poetry[
    #emph[Conquered by the prayers of men, the heavenly powers to earth]
  ]
  #p_poetry[
    #emph[Convene and cause the future to be revealed.]#t_footnote(<nt2391>, "nr2391")[6]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But the sharing of divinity with the human mind happens because good spirits willingly assist us and share their power and virtue with us. They help us daily with illuminations, inspirations, oracles, predictions, dreams, wonders, portents, divinations, and auguries. They work and act in our souls#t_footnote(<nt2392>, "nr2392")[7] as sharers of each other’s images, forming them by their influences and making us like themselves, so that often our souls almost work wonders, which the celestial daemons often do.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[The reason of assisting daemons.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, we conquer evil daemons with the assistance of good [daemons], especially when we implore to the influence of the sanctity of God with sacred words and sing frightful sermons—conjuring divine powers by venerable names and signs of supernatural virtues, by miracles, sacraments, sacred mysteries, and the like. Certain conjurations and exorcisms are made by religious names and divine virtues because malignant daemons fear them. Profane men also often bind or humble evil daemons by sacred conjurations of this kind who cannot accomplish these things.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    In his book #emph[Because Idols Are Not Gods,] Cyprian said that daemons, when sworn by the true God, immediately concede to us, confess, and are forced to leave possession of the body, and either immediately burst forth or vanish by degrees, according to how the faith of the patient helps or how the grace of the swearer aspires.#t_footnote(<nt2393>, "nr2393")[8]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    And Athanasius in his book #emph[Of Various Questions] said there is no more terrible word and destructive magic to the power of daemons than the beginning of the 67th psalm,#t_footnote(<nt2394>, "nr2394")[9] [which says:] “Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered.” Indeed, with those words first spoken, they soon vanish howling, and the devil disappears.#t_footnote(<nt2395>, "nr2395")[10]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    And in #emph[Against Celsus,] Origen said that he observed that pronouncing the name of Jesus very often expels innumerable daemons from the souls of men. Furthermore, it is in their bodies that it exercises the greatest power, casting out daemons.#t_footnote(<nt2396>, "nr2396")[11]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Also, often we either bind or repel evil daemons with threats and indignities, especially lesser [daemons] or lamiae, incubi, and the like. [It is] just as we read from Lucan of that sorceress saying:
  ]
  #p_poetry[
    #emph[. . . I will call you by your true name]

  #p_poetry[
    #emph[I will leave the Stygian dogs in the heavenly light]

    From Philostratus, we read that when Apollonius and his associates made their journey at night by a bright shining Moon, they met the phantom of a Lumia, which changed itself into one figure and then another, then suddenly vanished from sight. Apollonius recognized what it was, rebuked it in serious and insulting words, and encouraged his associates to do the same. Indeed, he knew that this was the best remedy for attacks of this kind. His associates obeyed what he said, and the phantom hissed and quickly flew away like a shadow.#t_footnote(<nt2398>, "nr2398")[13]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Indeed, as terrible as these kinds of daemons are, they can be moved, tremble, and are compelled with a feign terror, deceive, and make impossible threats. Of this, Chaeremon the sacred scribe said that these are things that especially convene daemons.#t_footnote(<nt2399>, "nr2399")[14] 
Additionally (as we said above) certain kinds of daemons are not entirely 
harmful but are very close to men, so that they are also affected by human 
passions and very much delight in being familiar with men and willingly live 
with them. Others rejoice in partnership with women, others children, others 
different domestic or wild animals. Still others inhabit forests and woods, or live in fountains and meadows. Thus, Fauns and Lemures live in fields, Naiads in springs, Potamides in rivers, Nymphs in pools and waters, Oreades in mountains, Humedes in meadows. Dryads and Hamadryads [are found] in woods, where Satyrs and Sylvani especially live and rejoice in trees and sod. Thus, Naptas and Agaptas live in flowers, Dodonas in acorns, and Paleas and Fenilias in fodder and the countryside.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, whoever wishes to invoke them, it is easiest in places where they stay, drawing them with the scents of fumigations, pleasant 
sounds, with chords and musical instruments, which are made from the intestines 
of certain animals and appropriate woods. Indeed, [these things are used for] 
summoning them with songs, poems, and enchantments that are agreeable to them. This is to be especially done with a simple character, innocent mind, firm belief, and steadfast silence. Accordingly, they often meet children, women, more humble common people, and obscure little men; but those [humans] with a steadfast and bold mind [daemons] fear: [before such people] they flee and tremble. [I speak here of beings which are] good and inoffensive to the world, but harmful to evil and impure men. Lemures, Lares, and Larvae,#t_footnote(<nt2400>, "nr2400")[15] along with other shades of the dead and makers of terror, are of this kind are also.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Hence, Plotinus said that the souls of men are sometimes daemons and that Lares can be made from men if they merit good. These the Greeks called “Eudaemonas”—that is, blessed daemons. Harmful daemons such as Lemures and Larvae are made from men if they merit evil. These the Greeks called “Cacodaemons.” Daemons are called “Manes” when they come from the soul of a man with an uncertain character.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Lares, Lemures, and Larvae are from men.]

  #p_normal[
    There are more examples of those apparitions, such as what Pliny the Younger remembered of the house of Athenodorus, the philosopher of Tarsus. [Pliny described hearing] a horrible, annoying sound; they observed the phantom of an old man. Philostratus likewise wrote of a Lamia of the philosopher Menippus the Lycian, which turned into a beautiful woman of Corinth. Apollonius of Tyana apprehended this daemon as a Lemure [rather than a Lamia]. [Apollonius also saw] at Ephesus a [Lemure] that imitated the likeness of an old beggar. [This Lemure] caused a plague but was overwhelmed by stones thrown by the order [of Apollonius.] There appeared a hunting dog [in the place of the old beggar] and soon the plague ceased.#t_footnote(<nt2401>, "nr2401")[16]

    We must know that whoever works in evil with daemons intellectually can be bound by the power of good. However, those who work only in a worldly manner will work for himself in judgment to hell.

    Chapter 33. Of the chains of spirits, and of their adjurations and expulsions.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    There are three [kinds of powers we call] chains, by which the spirits are bound and implored or expelled. Some are taken from the elemental world. Take, for example, the practice of using more inferior or natural things, for which a spirit may have an affinity or be adverse, to adjure a given daemon when we would wish to invoke or expel them. [Such natural things] as flowers, herbs, animals, snows, ices, Tartarus,#t_footnote(<nt2402>, "nr2402")[1] 
fire, and the like [are employed to this end]. These are often engrafted with 
divine praises, blessings, and consecrations, as is shown in the song of the three children,#t_footnote(<nt2403>, "nr2403")[2] in the Psalm “Praise the Lord of the heavens,”#t_footnote(<nt2404>, "nr2404")[3] and in the consecration and blessing of the paschal candle.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Accordingly, this [power we term a] chain works by a seizing virtue in spirits under the reason of love or hatred. The spirits that preside favor or abhor something natural or also beyond natural, just as these kinds of things also mutually love or hate each other. Hence, Proclus said: “As the lion especially fears the white rooster, thus spirits appearing in the form of a lion before a rooster suddenly disappear.”#t_footnote(<nt2405>, "nr2405")[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The second chain is taken from the celestial world—that is, when we adjure by the heavens, stars, their motions, rays, light, grace, clarity, nobility, strength, influence, wonders, and the like. This chain works in spirits through the manner of certain warnings and examples. It also has a certain amount of command, especially in ministering spirits and those from the lowest orders.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[The third.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The third chain is from the intellectual and divine world. It perfects religion, as for example when we adjure from sacraments, wonders, divine names, sacred seals, and other religious mysteries. This chain is the most supreme and strongest of all, commanding spirits [with exceptional] power.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Order is maintained in chains.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But this must be observed: just as after universal providence is a particular providence, and after the universal soul is a particular soul,#t_footnote(<nt2406>, "nr2406")[5] we first invoke by the more superior chains, and by the names and virtues that rule things, then by the more inferior and things themselves.
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Who is bound by these chains.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    We must also know that not only spirits but also all creatures— including tempests, fires, floods, plagues, illnesses, the power of arms, and each animal—are bound by these chains. They assume [these chains] whether by the method of adjuration, prayer, or blessing: as in the adjuration of serpents, besides the natural and celestial, commemorating from the mysteries and religion the curse of the serpent in the earthly Paradise,#t_footnote(<nt2407>, "nr2407")[6] the raising of serpents in the desert,#t_footnote(<nt2408>, "nr2408")[7] and additionally by taking the 99th verse in Psalms: “You will walk over the asp and basilisk and you will tread upon the lion and dragon.”#t_footnote(<nt2409>, "nr2409")[8]
  ]
  #p_quote[
    #emph[Superstition is very strong.]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Superstition also very much exerts an influence in these by translating some sacramental rites to that which we intend to bind or impede. For example, [rites intended for] excommunication, burials, or funerary processions [might be used] for banishing illnesses, serpents, mice, or worms. We read in many places that this has been done and still often happens.

    Chapter 34. Of the animistical order and heroes.

  #p_normal[
    After the choruses of blessed spirits, the next is the animistical order, which the Hebrew theologians call #emph[Issim]—namely, the “strong and valiant men” who gentile magicians call heroes, demigods, or half gods. Fulgentius (an author not to be scorned) therefore thought that either [these heroes] were not thought worthy of heaven because of their humble circumstances, nor thought terrestrial because of their respect for grace, of which kind Priapus, Hippo, and Vertumnus once were,#t_footnote(<nt2410>, "nr2410")[1] or because they excelled in life in divine virtues and benefits for the human species. After this mortal man departs, he is translated into the blessed chorus of gods, perpetually providing for mortals the same virtues and blessings they once had in this life; or because they were begat from a secret superior seed, which they thought was mixed from gods or daemons with men, and therefore obtain a certain middle nature, so that they are neither angels or men, of which opinion Lactantius also followed.#t_footnote(<nt2411>, "nr2411")[2]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    There are even those today who have intercourse and conjugal mixture with daemons; and now all believe that Merlin, a British prophet, was the son of a daemon born from a virgin; but Plato, prince of wisdom, was imagined to have been born from a virgin who was overwhelmed by a phantom of Apollo.#t_footnote(<nt2412>, "nr2412")[3]

    Historians relate that certain Gothic women (called Alrumnas), who were known for their appearance and ingenuity, were once driven from their camp by the Gothic king Filimirus (or as others say) Idanthresus.#t_footnote(<nt2413>, "nr2413")[4] They 
traveled across the Asian wilderness of Scythia across the swamps of Meotides, 
and there were impregnated by Fauns and Satyrs, who first begat the Huns.#t_footnote(<nt2414>, "nr2414")[5] 
Indeed, the author Psellus said that daemons sometimes cast seed from which 
certain small creatures arise.#t_footnote(<nt2415>, "nr2415")[6]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, these heroes have no less power in disposing and ruling these more inferiors than gods and daemons. They have their duties and protections distributed to them, for which reason they had temples, likenesses, altars, sacrifices, vows, and other religious mysteries expressed to them and not alongside the gods themselves. Their names had divine magical virtues and performed certain miracles when invoked. Eusebius narrated that for this reason many tried to invoke the name of Apollonius of Tyana.#t_footnote(<nt2416>, "nr2416")[7] We read of many more [descriptions] of this kind from ancient poets, historians, and philosophers [who speak] of Hercules, Atlas, Asclepius, and certain other gentile heroes; but these are the delusions of heathens.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    However, of our sacred heroes, we believe that divine power influences them. Truly the soul of the Messiah#t_footnote(<nt2417>, "nr2417")[8] Jesus Christ rules over all of them, and Hebrew theologians also confirm this. [Jesus,] by his diverse saints, administers and distributes the diverse gifts of this grace to these more inferiors, just as if [these saints were] members [of his body] adapted to this, each saint being chosen to work with a particular gift. By our appeals of various prayers and invocations [to saints, they] freely bestow to each of us their gifts, favors, and grace, according to the multiform distribution of that grace. Indeed, [saints do this] more readily and abundantly than angelic powers, because they are closer to us and more similar to our natures. Also, since they were once men and endured human affects and weaknesses, their names, degrees, and offices are well known to us.

    Therefore, of this almost infinite number, there are twelve princes—namely, the twelve apostles of Christ, who, as the gospel of truth said, sit upon the twelve tribunals and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.

We admire, worship, and venerate [such people] as gods, because God Himself has allowed His name to be shared, and with His own name has secured it to them, calling them gods, just as Moses said: “I have made you a god to Pharaoh.”#t_footnote(<nt2423>, "nr2423")[1] He [also] taught elsewhere, saying: “You will not speak ill of the gods,”#t_footnote(<nt2424>, "nr2424")[2] and again: “If the theft lies hidden, the lord of the house will apply himself to the gods.”#t_footnote(<nt2425>, "nr2425")[3] The psalmist said: “The princes of the people were gathered with the god of Abraham, because the strong gods of the earth are vehemently lifted up.”#t_footnote(<nt2426>, "nr2426")[4] [We read] elsewhere [in Psalms]: “God stood in the council of gods, but in their midst He judged the gods”#t_footnote(<nt2427>, "nr2427")[5] and somewhat later: “I have said you are gods and all of you sons of the Most High.”#t_footnote(<nt2428>, "nr2428")[6]

    However, He also taught of worshipping and venerating them, decreeing tithes and first fruits for them, presenting the law of the sword, forbidding [anyone] to curse them, and requiring obedience, although wicked.

    The divine Plato wrote in the third book of #emph[The Republic] that princes alive or dead should be celebrated with divine honors.#t_footnote(<nt2430>, "nr2430")[8] This instruction was always received from all nations and from the first age—that is, to deify princes with divine honors and consecrate them with an eternal memory. Hence, they imposed their never abandoned names to cities, provinces, mountains, rivers, lakes, islands, and seas; then pyramids, colossi, triumphal arches, trophies, statues, shrines, games, and festivals were dedicated with great pomp. They also called the heavens, stars, days, months by their names; hence, January is from Janus, July from Julius, August from Augustus, thus the day Hermes#t_footnote(<nt2431>, "nr2431")[9] from Hermes Trismegistus, and the day Jove#t_footnote(<nt2432>, "nr2432")[10] from Jove.

    These customs we read are not only observed by the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans but also by the remote barbarian Goths, Danes, and Teutons. Hence (as Saxo Grammaticus testified) what day [we] call Mercury, [the barbarians] would call that day Othin,#t_footnote(<nt2433>, "nr2433")[11] and what [we call] Jove, they call Thor. [Though they venerated these figures as gods,] Othin and Thor were once Gothic and Danish kings.#t_footnote(<nt2434>, "nr2434")[12] Futhermore, the Goths are not called by that name for any other reason than the highest god in their tongue is called Gotthum. Hence, the Teutons are called that because they worshipped the god Mars, whom they called Teutanem, which is also the name the Gauls called Mercury. Therefore, kings and pontiffs—but only if just—are companions to gods and strengthened by a similar power. Hence, they can cure the sick by only their touch or word and sometimes command the seasons and heavens, as Virgil sang of Augustus:

    The Almighty God, as [Hermes] Trismegistus said, molded two images like himself—namely, the world and man—in which with one he would play in certain wonderful operations, but in the other, he might enjoy his delights.#t_footnote(<nt2441>, "nr2441")[1] Since God is one, He created one world; since He is infinite, He created a round world; since He is eternal, He created an incorruptible and eternal world; since He is immense, He created the greatest world; since He is the sum of life, He has also adorned the world with vital seeds, begetting everything from itself; since He is omnipotent, with only His own will, He created the world without any necessary nature and no preexisting material, but from nothing. Since He is the sum of goodness, He embraced His word, which is the first Idea of all things. He did this with His greatest will and essential love, and made the outer world from the model of the inner. [The inner world] is the ideal world, yet nothing was transmitted from the essence of Ideas, but rather [God] created [the outer world] from nothing. He accomplished this through the Idea from the eternal.

    God also created man in His image:#t_footnote(<nt2442>, "nr2442")[2] for, as the image of God is the world, thus the image of the world is man.#t_footnote(<nt2443>, "nr2443")[3] Hence they think, and some have said, that man is not simply created in the image of God, but according to the image, as it were, an image of an image.#t_footnote(<nt2444>, "nr2444")[4] Therefore [man] is called the microcosm—namely, the lesser world. The world is a rational animal and immortal, and likewise man is a rational animal, but mortal—which is to say, dissoluble. As Hermes said, since the world is immortal, it is impossible that some part will perish. Thus, death is an empty name, just as a vacuum is nowhere.#t_footnote(<nt2445>, "nr2445")[5] Therefore, when we say a man dies, his soul separates from his body. He does not perish or turns into nothing.#t_footnote(<nt2446>, "nr2446")[6]

    Nevertheless, the true image of God is His Word, wisdom, life, light, and truth, by which He Himself exists, of which the human soul is the image. Accordingly, we are said to be made in the image of God, not in the image of the world or creatures: for, as God cannot be touched, perceived with ears, or seen by eyes, thus the soul of man cannot be seen, heard, or touched. As God is infinite and cannot be compelled, thus the human soul is free and cannot be forced or measured. As God bears the entire world and all that is in it entirely in His mind, thus also the human mind embraces [the world] even in thought, and that which is singular only to God. As God moves and governs the entire world with only his nod, thus the human mind moves and rules his body with only a nod. Therefore, it is necessary that the mind of man is sealed with the Word of God and the human body endued to the most complete model of the world.

    Thus, man is called “the other world” and “the other image of God,” because he has all that is in the greater world contained within him, so that there is nothing left that is not truly and actually also found in man himself; and all of these perform the same offices in him as in the greater world. In him there are the elements with the truest qualities of their nature; and in him is a small ethereal body, a vehicle of the soul, with the proportion corresponding to the heavens; in him is the vegetative life of plants, senses of animals, celestial spirits, angelic reason, and a divine mind: and the true conjunction and divine possession of all of these are likewise in one confluence. Hence, the holy scriptures call men “every creature,”#t_footnote(<nt2447>, "nr2447")[7] and man is not only made the other world containing all parts within himself but also conceives and contains God Himself. Hence, Sextus#t_footnote(<nt2448>, "nr2448")[8] the Pythagorean said that the soul of man is the temple of God, which Paul expressed much more clearly, saying: “The temple of God is you.” The same is testified in many places in the holy scriptures.

    Therefore, man is the most distinct likeness of God since man contains in himself all that is in God: but God, by a certain eminence, contains everything with His virtue and simply as the cause and beginning of all. He has given this virtue to man as he likewise contains all, but is like a certain action and composition, as a tie, chain, and knot to all.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, only man enjoys this honor because he has a symbol with all, an operation with all, and a familiarity with all. He symbolizes with matter in an individual foundation, with elements in a fourfold body, with plants in a vegetative virtue, with animals in a sensitive [virtue], with the heavens in an ethereal spirit, and influences the more inferior parts with the more superior, with angels in intellect and wisdom, and with God in containing all. He is preserved#t_footnote(<nt2449>, "nr2449")[9] with God and the intelligences by faith and wisdom, with the heavens and celestials by reason and wandering about, with all of the more inferiors by senses, lordship, and acting with everything: and everything is possible—even in God Himself, by understanding and loving Him.

    And as God knows everything, thus also man can know the knowable, since he has a comparable objective; a common being, or (as others say) truth itself. There is nothing, no disposition found in man, in which something divine does not shine, nor is there anything in God that is also not found in man.

    Therefore, whoever recognizes himself will recognize that all things are to be found in himself. He will first recognize God, from whose image he was made; he will recognize the world, whose likeness he bears; he will recognize all creatures, with which he is a symbol, and what aid he can have and can obtain from stones, plants, animals, elements, the heavens, daemons, angels, and how each [thing] is made to fit in their place, time, order, measure, proportion, and harmony, attracting and repelling from itself like iron to a magnet.#t_footnote(<nt2450>, "nr2450")[10]

Then the spirits, animal powers, vegetative powers, and the elements all the way to [complex] matter are drawn with him and the body, which is his form. He is brought forth to a better fate and celestial nature until he is glorified in immortality. This (which we have said) is the personal gift to man. This dignity of a divine image is special to him and is shared with no other creature.

    There are other theologians who assign three powers of man (memory, intellect, and will) to the image of the divine Trinity. There are also those who go further and [arrange] them not only in those three powers, which are called “first acts,” but they also place this image in secondary acts: as thus memory is the Father, intellect represents the Son, and will the Holy Ghost. Thus, also the word produced from our intellect and love flowing from our will, having a present object and producing the same, indicating the Son, Spirit, and Father.

    Additionally, the more secret theologians teach that each of our members represents something in God and as such bear His image. Even in each of our passions we represent God, but by a certain analogy: for in the holy scriptures we read of the anger, fury, repentance, complacency, goodwill, hatred, games, delight, pleasure, and indignation of God, and many more like these. We have spoken something above about the members of God,#t_footnote(<nt2453>, "nr2453")[13] but it may be also appropriate here.

    Mercury Trismegistus also confessed of the divine Trinity, describing [it as composed of] intellect, life, and brightness, elsewhere called words, mind, and spirit. [According to Hermes] man is made in the image of God represented in the same Trinity.#t_footnote(<nt2454>, "nr2454")[14] Indeed, an understanding 
mind, a vivifying word, and a spirit [each] belong to them as a divine 
brightness—diffusing itself on all sides, filling, moving, and connecting all. Yet, this is not understood from the natural spirit. [The natural spirit] is a medium through which the soul is united with the flesh and body, by which the body lives and works and one member works with another. We spoke of that spirit in the first book. [The spirit we address here] is driven by the rational#t_footnote(<nt2455>, "nr2455")[15] spirit, yet is also corporeal in a certain way. However, it does not have a heavy body, tangible and visible, but is a subtle body and easily united easily with the mind—that is, that more superior and divine [part] that is in us. One should not marvel if we say that the rational soul is that spirit and is corporeal or having and sensing some corporeality, while it is in the body and uses it just as an instrument, if you understand in the manner of the Platonists that that ethereal body of the soul is a vehicle.

    Plotinus and all Platonists after Trismegistus place three things in men, which are called the supreme, the lowest, and the middle. The supreme is that divine thing, which is called the mind, superior part, or illuminated intellect. In Genesis, Moses called it the breath of life, which comes from God or from His Holy Spirit breathing into us. The lowest is the sensitive soul, which is also called an 
#emph[idolum,]#t_footnote(<nt2456>, "nr2456")[16] and Paul the apostle called the “animal man.” The middle is the rational spirit, connecting and binding each extreme—that is, the animal soul with the mind, and the wise nature of each extreme. However, it differs from the most supreme, which is called the illuminated intellect, mind, light, and the supreme part. It also differs from the animal soul, from which the apostle said we must separate by the virtue of the Word of God, saying: “The Word of God is alive and effective and is more penetrable than a two-edged sword reaching all the way to the division of the soul and spirit.” Indeed, as that supreme part never sins, never consents to evil, and always resists error and encourages the best; thus, that lowest part and animal soul is always immersed in evil, sin, and concupiscence and draws to ruin, of which Paul said: “I see another law in my members and captivating me in the law of sin.”

    Therefore, since it is the highest part, the mind is never damned, but when its associates are punished, it departs uninjured toward its source. However, the spirit, which Plotinus called the rational soul, since by its nature is free and can adhere to each as it pleases if it firmly adheres to the superior part, it is, in the end, united and blessed with it, while assumed into God. If it adheres to the lowest soul, it is depraved and lessened, while it is made an evil daemon.#t_footnote(<nt2457>, "nr2457")[17] But this is enough of the mind and spirit, so we will now consider speech or words.

  #p_normal[
    Indeed, speech or words “without which nothing can be accomplished”#t_footnote(<nt2459>, "nr2459")[19] or can happen, is the expression of both the expresser and the thing expressed, and the speech of the speaker. That which is spoken is speech and words are the conception of the conceiver; and that which is conceived is words and the writing of the writer and that which writes is the word and the forming of the former; and that which is formed is the word and the creation of the creator; and that which is created is the word and the doing of the doer, and that which is created is the word and the knowledge of the knower; and that which is known is the word and all that can be said is nothing, unless there is a word and it is called 
#emph[equality]. Indeed, it equally manages itself with everything, since it is not one thing more than another. It grants equally to everything, as they are neither more nor less. Being sensible, it makes all things sensible, as light makes itself and all things visible.

    But conception—that is, the process by which the mind conceives itself—is the inner word generated from the mind, this being the knowledge of itself. However, the outer and vocal word is the offspring and presentation of that [inner] word, and the breath signifying something proceeds from the mouth with sound and voice: but all of our voices, words, and speeches, mix with the air and will vanish unless they are formed by the voice of God. The spirit and Word of God remain and accompany life.

    The human soul is a certain divine light created according to the image of the Word, the cause of causes, the first exemplar, and the substance of God, formed with a seal whose character is the eternal Word.#t_footnote(<nt2472>, "nr2472")[1] Likewise, the human soul is a certain divine substance, indivisible and present in every part of the body, thus produced by an incorporeal author so that it depends only on the virtue of the agent, not from the womb of matter. The soul is a substantial number, uniform, transformative with itself, rational, far surpassing all bodies and matter, whose division is not according to matter, nor from inferior and dense things, but rising from the effective cause. Indeed, it is not a quantitative number but removed from all corporeal laws. Because of this, it is not divided or multiplied by parts.#t_footnote(<nt2473>, "nr2473")[2]

    Therefore, according to Platonic opinion, the human soul proceeds immediately from God and is [then after] joined by a medium that is suitable to this denser body. Indeed, from its first descent, it is enveloped in a celestial and airy body, which is called a celestial vehicle of the soul and which others call the chariot of the soul.#t_footnote(<nt2475>, "nr2475")[4] This medium, appointed by God, is the center of the world and is first infused into the middle point of the heart, which is the center of the human body. It is then diffused into all of the parts and members of the body. When it joins its chariot to natural heat, the spirit born from the heart through this heat. Through this [spirit, the soul] plunges into the humors. Through [the humors] it clings to the members. All of these [members] are made equally close [to the soul], although [it is] transferred from one to the other, just as heat adheres most closely to air and water, although it is taken by air to water. Thus, it is plain how the immortal soul by an immortal body—that is, an ethereal vehicle [of the soul]—is enclosed by a dense and mortal soul.

    However, when these mediums dissolve or fail by sickness or evil, then the soul recovers itself through each medium and flows back into the heart, which is the first receptacle of the soul. But when the spirit of the heart fails, and its heat is extinguished, it abandons him. The man dies and the soul flies away with this ethereal vehicle, and his guardians, his genius, and daemon follow it and carry it to the judge.

the light of justice, reason, and the judgment of separating right from wrong, 
purging light from the darkness of ignorance, discovering the glory and charity of truth, the queen of all virtues; by Venus a fervent love, sweetest hope, desire of movement, order, concupiscence, beauty, charm, growing desire, and propagation of itself; by Mercury a penetrating faith and belief, plain reasoning, a vigor of interpreting and pronouncing, a grave eloquence, a sharp ingenuity, a rational discourse and swiftly moving senses; by the Moon a pacifying harmony, fertility, a power of generating and increasing, increase and decrease and moderate temperance and faith, which maneuvers in known and hidden things offering leadership to all, also the motion of tilling the earth for the manner of life and granting augmentation for itself and others.#t_footnote(<nt2477>, "nr2477")[1] These influences are principally drawn from these seven intelligences who stand before the face of God, who disposes the soul, the seat of these virtues.

    These are degrees or ladders by which men can easily ascend to any kind of virtue by a certain natural connection and chariot according to the various dispositions of the body and soul, the favor of the stars in the disposition of the body, and the intelligences presiding over them.

    Because all virtues and powers are from above, from God, from the intelligences, and from the stars and do not err and cannot cause evil, it is necessary that all evil and anything whatsoever that is found discordant and dissonant in these more inferiors are not from evil influences, but from an evil disposition arising from the receiver. As Chrysippus rightly sang:

    Therefore, when the perverseness of the subject receives perverse influences, or its debility cannot tolerate the effectiveness of the superiors, then influences full of discord from the celestials are received into matter, resulting in dissonance, deformity, and evil; yet, celestial powers always remain good. While they exist in themselves and are influenced from the Giver of Lights through the holy intelligences and heavens until they reach [the sphere of] the Moon, their influence is good as in the first stage, but then when it is received by a viler subject, it also becomes vile. Indeed, then—according to the diverse nature of the recipient—it is received in diverse ways. The disagreeing qualities in the same subject in itself, and it varies and suffers with the suffering subject. Hence, everything is finally taken hold by the subject, and something else results other than the superior influences.#t_footnote(<nt2486>, "nr2486")[3]

    Therefore, harmful qualities in these more inferiors are far different from celestial influences. In the same way as light should not be blamed for sore eyes, fire for burning, a sword for wounds, and a judge for chains and prison, so evil influences should not be blamed on the celestials for evil dispositions and works. Thus, if we are well-disposed with the superior influences, we “cooperate in all good things.” If [we are] evilly disposed because of our sins, the divine which is in us departs, making way for all evil things.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, the cause of all of our evils is sin, which is the disorder and distemper in our souls. If [sin is] evilly ruling [us], or prostrating and declining [us] from what the celestial influences require, everything rebels and is distempered for our ruin. Then in the human body, which would be otherwise composed with the most temperate and most agreeable harmony, distempered elements are born; evil humors arise; even the good become disordered and separated from themselves with a certain vicissitude; the body is vexed and tortured. Then, a most vehement dissonance is perceived either from excess, diminution, an internal#t_footnote(<nt2487>, "nr2487")[4] accident, or excessive food. From [any of these causes], excessive humors [can be] generated and illness arise. The bridle of the animal spirit is also broken in the battle [when sin wins out in our nature]. Then the celestial influences—otherwise good in and of themselves—become harmful, just as the light of the Sun is evilly disposed to the eyes.

The Sun [influences] imperious pride and insatiable ambition. Venus [influences] the deceits of concupiscence, lustful love, and ugly pleasure. Mercury [influences] fraud, treachery, lies, evil machinations and the eagerness for sin. The Moon [influences] increasing instability of all things and whatever is contrary to human nature.

    With no small amount of experience, it has been proved that man is engrafted with a dominant nature and a certain power of binding. As Pliny testified, if an elephant meets a man wandering in the wilderness, he is merciful and gentle and shows him the way. It is also said that [if an elephant] sees the footsteps of a man before seeing him, it shakes in fear of ambush, stops, and looks around frightened. In the same way, a tiger—the most ferocious of all wild beasts—is said to immediately carry away its babies when it sees a man. There is much more like this written by various authors in great volumes about animals.

    Why do these animals know to fear man, if they have never seen him? Since [animals] have such excellent size, strength, and speed, what is this nature of man that strikes fear in them if they have seen him and know why they fear him? Indeed, all historians inquire and acknowledge this but leave it to others to teach and prove.

    Therefore, as we read from Philostratus on this subject, Apollonius of Tyana saw a boy leading a huge elephant. [His companion] Damis asked why such a huge animal was obedient to such a small child. [The boy] answered that it was from a certain active terror sent to man by the Maker, which all inferior creatures and animals perceive, that they fear and stand in awe of man. This is like a terrifying character and seal God has impressed on man, in which he is superior to everything, and they recognize him as supreme, whether a slave or an animal. Indeed, otherwise a boy would be unable to rule a herd or elephants, a king to frighten his people, nor a judge [to frighten] the culprit.

    Therefore, this character is impressed on man by the divine Idea, which the Hebrew kabbalists call Pachad, פחד, and the left hand or sword of God. However, man has not only a sign by which he is feared but also [a sign] by which he is loved, whose Idea in the divine numerations is called Chesed, חסד, which signifies clemency and the right hand and scepter of God.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Signs and characters are impressed onto each one of us from these divine numerations by the intelligences and stars according to our capacity and purity. The first man undoubtedly held these signs with every integrity and fullness when all living things—attracted by gentle tameness and subjected by terror—came to him as a lord so that he might impose a name onto them. However, after the sin of transgression, he fell from dignity with all of his posterity—yet that character is not entirely extinct in us, though however much more one is heavy with sin, that much more he is far from these divine characters and receives less from them. Whereas [man should] receive kindness and reverence from animals, men, and daemons, he falls into servitude and fear. Fearing this, Cain said to God: “All who find me, will kill me.” [This was] because he feared beasts and daemons, not just men, of whom there were few [at that time].

    It has been decided that all men generally die once.#t_footnote(<nt2490>, "nr2490")[1] Death is fated to all, but one is natural, another violent, another voluntarily accepted, another imposed for offenses of human law or inflicted by God, not due to nature, but seemingly as a punishment for sins. As Hebrew teachers say, God remits to none. Because of this, the agreement was delivered to Hezekiah, that after the house of the sanctuary was destroyed, although there was no order of judicial execution remaining, there was yet a fourfold kind of punishment, by which one can be condemned, that no one guilty of death can avoid retaliation. For those who deserve death by stones, God willing, would either be thrown headlong from a roof, tread upon by wild beasts, or crushed by a collapse or fall. However, those who deserve to be burned, should either be consumed by fire, his life finished by a venomous sting, a bite from a serpent, or his life finished by poison. But those who might be slain by a sword would be slaughtered by violence from the state, a rebellion of the people or a faction, or ambushed by robbers. Those who would be hanged by a noose would be either drowned in water or killed by some other strangulation.#t_footnote(<nt2491>, "nr2491")[2] The great Origen thought that when Christ is described in the Gospels as saying: “Who kills by the sword, dies by the sword,” the Messiah was referring to this aspect of the doctrine.

    Plotinus wrote of this in his book #emph[On Everyone’s Individual Daemon,]#t_footnote(<nt2494>, "nr2494")[5] saying: “Whoever kept a human quality will again be born a man. However, whoever only used their senses will return as brutish animals. Those who especially use senses together with anger arise as wild animals, but those who use senses through concupiscence and pleasure will arise as salacious and gluttonous animals. However, if they do not use their senses with one of these [passions], as living with degeneration of sense, will arise as plants: inasmuch as their cares were primarily or mostly of the vital part, that they were changed into plants. However, those who lived excessively bewitched by music and not deprived of other things, are born again as musical animals. Those who have reigned unreasonably, are made eagles, unless they are corrupted 
by some viciousness. However, those who follow a civil virtue, are born again as 
men.” In Proverbs, Solomon himself sometimes called man a lion, tiger, bear, or 
boar, and named others a hare, dog, a hunting or rabbit dog, an ant, hedgehog, a serpent or spider, an eagle, lizard, rooster, bird, and many more like this.#t_footnote(<nt2495>, "nr2495")[6] Hebrew kabbalists do not admit that souls are cast down into brutes, yet they do not deny that those who have thoroughly lost their reason in another life are left with a brutish disposition and imagination.

    Therefore, with the flesh abandoned and the body finished with life, it is called a corpse.

    Hence, it is not without cause that the ancient fathers ordained expiations of corpses, that what was most unclean should be sprinkled with holy water, incense burned, exorcized with holy orations, illuminated with lights for as long as it was over the earth. Finally, [the body was] to be buried in a sacred place.#t_footnote(<nt2505>, "nr2505")[16] Thus, Elpenor from Homer said: “I ask you, Ulysses, please remember me and do not leave me unburied, lest unburied I will anger the gods.”#t_footnote(<nt2506>, "nr2506")[17]

    The human mind,#t_footnote(<nt2507>, "nr2507")[18] which has a sacred nature and a divine birth, does not share punishment because it is always without fault.

It goes forth with its ethereal vehicle, passing freely with the choirs of heroes transcending or reaching for the heavens, where it enjoys a continuous blissful felicity with all of its senses and powers.

    Whereby this soul then, without an intelligible essence, is abandoned to the command of a raving fantasy.

Later the prophet#t_footnote(<nt2527>, "nr2527")[38] Tiresias suggested that his mother nibble and drink the black blood, and she immediately recognized her son and spoke to him, crying. However, the soul of the prophet Tiresias, despite the unsheathed sword, even before he nibbled the blood, recognized Ulysses and pointed out the shade of his mother assisting him.#t_footnote(<nt2528>, "nr2528")[39] Therefore, whatever wicked sins souls have collected in bodies in this life that are not expiated, carry their habits along with them to hell, forcing them to cleanse themselves and pay the penalty for their sins, which the poet explained in these verses: #emph[Why, when the light of life leaves for the last time,]

    Indeed, the unclean soul of a man, who in this life assembled too great a habit to the body, weaves another body for itself from the vapors of the elements, rebuilding from malleable matter as if drinking, and makes that body continuously vanishing. It does this with a certain inmost affection of the elemental body.It is also as if in a prison, and a sensible instrument carried by a certain divine law. Thus, it suffers cold, fire, and whatever offends the body and spirit,#t_footnote(<nt2534>, "nr2534")[45] such as foul odors, howls, wailings, hissings, lashings, cutting, and chains.

    Sometimes (and this is very rare) souls are driven to such insanity that they desire not only the bodies of the living, but—by a certain Stygian power—move to forsaken corpses and revive them to accomplish horrible deeds. We read from Saxo Grammaticus that a certain Asuitus and Asmundus vowed to each other that the one who lives longest would be buried with the one who died first. Finally, Asuitus was consumed by sickness and was taken to a vast tomb with his dog and horse, with whom Asmundus, because of his vow of friendship, allowed himself to be buried alive, taking meat to feed on for a long time. At last Ericus, king of Suecia, was passing through the place of the tomb of Asuitus with his army. Thinking there was a treasure, he broke it apart, throwing open a hole, leading Asmundus to the light. [Ericus] saw [Asmundus’s] foul face with the putrefaction of funerary soil and a bloody scar with blood flowing from it, because Asuitus repeatedly revived during the night, and in his struggles wrenched off [Asmundus’s] left ear.

    Pausanias referred to an account not unlike this, taken from the interpreters of Delphi—namely, that there was a certain infernal daemon whom they called Eurynomus, who took the flesh of the dead and ate it so that there was hardly a bare skeleton left.#t_footnote(<nt2542>, "nr2542")[53] We also read in the annals of Crete of manes that were called “Carechanas.” These often return to their bodies, come to their widows, and satisfy their lust. To avoid this, so that they will not vex their wives anymore, it was stipulated in municipal laws that the heart of those rising shall be pierced by a nail, and the entire corpse burned. Without a doubt, these are fanciful [sounding stories]. They may not seem to be very credible, but these extensive laws [related to the things they describe] and [the mention of such things in] ancient histories make them credible.

    Similarly, we should not regard it as strange from the Christian religion that many souls can revive before the resurrection of the whole flesh of their bodies. In fact, we believe that many, by the singular favor of God, are taken with their bodies to glory . . . and also that many descend alive into hell. We have also heard that bodies of the dead are often removed from their graves by daemons, without a doubt for any other use than to be imprisoned and tortured by their hands.

    However, neither do I think that we should disregard what many of our [faith] think about receptacles of souls, who do not disagree much from what we have just said. Of this Tertullian said in the fourth book of his
#emph[Against the Heresies of Marcion:] “It is apparent to each wise man who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place which is called the bosom of Abraham for receiving the souls of his sons, and that this area is not heavenly, yet it is higher than hell, ‘where the souls of the just rest,’ until the consummation of all things, which will restore the resurrection with the fullness of reward.”#t_footnote(<nt2558>, "nr2558")[69] In fact, Peter the apostle asked Clement of these things: “You force me, O Clement, to disclose indescribable things; but yet as far as I am allowed to mention them I will not regret it. Christ, from the very beginning was always with the pious,in each generation. Although [he was with them] secretly, [he was] yet always near. He frequently appeared, especially to those who waited for Him. However, it was not yet the time then to resurrect the bodies that were dissolved. This was either a recompense from God that those who are found just should remain longer in a body, or at least as is clearly referred in the scriptures of certain just men, that the Lord transferred them. In a like example, others who pleased God’s will were also carried away, being transferred to Paradise will be kept for the Kingdom. However, those who could not entirely fulfill the standard of justice and had some remnant of wickedness in their flesh, indeed had their bodies decay after death, though their souls were protected in good and happy regions, so that in the resurrection of the dead when they might recover their bodies, being cleansed with resolution, they will acquire an eternal inheritance according to the things they have done well.”#t_footnote(<nt2559>, "nr2559")[70]

    Likewise, Irenaeus in the end of his book #emph[Against the Heresies of the Valentinians] said: “Since the Lord went in the middle of the shadow of death, where the souls of the dead were, then later corporally arose and after the resurrection was taken up, it is undoubted that the souls of his disciples, for whom the Lord did these works, shall depart to the invisible place assigned to them by God and remain there awaiting for resurrection. Afterward, their bodies will be received and will arise perfectly—that is, corporally—just as the Lord resurrected. Thus, they will come into the presence of God. Indeed, no disciple is above the master, but all who are perfect are like their master. Therefore, just as our master did not immediately fly away and depart but waited for the time of his resurrection defined by the Father (also shown through Jonah) He arose and was taken up after three days. Thus, we must also await resurrection for a time defined by God and foretold by the prophets.

    Augustine and Ambrose are of the same opinion. In [Augustine’s] #emph[Enchiridion] it is said: “[During] the time which is interposed between the death of man and the final resurrection, the soul is held in hidden receptacles, as each is worthy of rest or toil according to that which it obtained while it lived in the flesh.”#t_footnote(<nt2562>, "nr2562")[73] Ambrose, in his book 
#emph[Death as a Good,] said: “The Scripture of Ezra called the homes of souls storerooms, which meeting human complaints, that the just who preceded them seem to be all the way to the day of judgment—namely, for a long time—to be cheated of the recompense they are owed, [the scriptures] wonderfully say that judgment day is like a crown. Indeed, the day of the crown is expected by all, that until that day, the conquered may be ashamed, and the conquerors can gain the palm of victory. Therefore, while waiting for the fullness of time, souls expect the recompense they are owed: punishment remaining for some, glory for others.”#t_footnote(<nt2563>, "nr2563")[74] In the same chapter, he called hell a place that is not seen, where souls desire to be freed from bodies. In the second book of 
#emph[On Cain and Abel] he said: “The soul is loosened from the body, and after the end of this life, future judgment is still yet uncertain, being in suspense.”#t_footnote(<nt2564>, "nr2564")[75]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The Gospel of the Last Judgment supports these, as Christ said in Matthew: “Many will say to me in that day: ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name, and in your name cast out daemons, and in your name made many miracles?’ and I will confess that I never knew them.”#t_footnote(<nt2565>, "nr2565")[76] From this speech, it seems to agree that all the way to this day, they who were uncertain of their sentence and trusted miracles which were completed in Jesus’s name while they live, a certain hope of salvation meanwhile has been suspended.

    Therefore, because the judgment of souls is delayed until the last day, most theologians think that atoning for judgment can help not only the just but also the damned; thus, Trajan Caesar was freed from the underworld by the blessed Gregory and justified to salvation, although some think that he was not freed from the penalty of the crime, but that instead the justice of punishment was put off until the Day of Judgment. However, Thomas Aquinas said it seems to be more probable that from the blessed Gregory’s intercession of Trajan he lived again, and a gracious power followed, which freed him from punishment and the bondage of sin.

    There are theologians who suppose that intercession from hell does not lift punishment nor lessen guilt, but only brings a certain comfort and alleviation of pain. This is like the sweating bearer of burden, where the sprinkling of water seems to lift the pressure of the weight, or helps him bear it more easily, although none of the weight has been lifted. Yet the common opinion of theologians denies that any prayers and funerary rites can intercede to negate the guilty from the cave of Dis.#t_footnote(<nt2566>, "nr2566")[77] However, since all of these are of an incomprehensible obscurity, many have vainly sharpened their wits on them.

  #p_normal[
    From what we have already said, it should be clear that souls love the bodies they left after death—for there are souls whose bodies are without their due burial, or who left their bodies from a violent death, and thus wander around their bodies with a turbulent and moist spirit as if drawn by some affinity to them.#t_footnote(<nt2568>, "nr2568")[1] They recognize those mediums by which they were once joined to their bodies and could easily be called and drawn forth by similar vapors, fluids, and fumes. Furthermore, they could also be summoned by certain artificial lights, songs, sounds, and the like, which excite the imaginative and spiritual harmony of the soul. Sacred invocations and the like, which are from religion, should not be neglected because of the superior nature of the rational portion of the soul. Thus, we read of the sorceress who summoned Samuel,#t_footnote(<nt2569>, "nr2569")[2] and we also read from Lucan of the prophet of Thessaly who raised a corpse.#t_footnote(<nt2570>, "nr2570")[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Hence we read from poets and those who can relate things like this, that souls of the dead cannot be summoned without blood and a corpse, but their shades can be easily drawn by fumigations of these things, to which eggs, milk, honey, oil, wine, water, and flour can be added, since they are an excellent medium for souls to reach their bodies, just as we read in Homer of a long instruction where Circe teaches Ulysses.#t_footnote(<nt2571>, "nr2571")[4]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    They think that these things can only be done in places where these kinds of souls are known to be most situated, either because of some affinity, as if their abandoned body was drawing them because of some affection once imprinted in their life drawing the soul to some place, or because some hellish nature of a place, therefore suitable for purging or punishing souls. Such places are most known by the experience of visions, nocturnal incursions, and similar occurrences of phantoms. Some are sufficiently known by themselves, such as cemeteries, places where criminals are often executed, places where there were public massacres in recent years, or where in recent years corpses of the slain are buried but not correctly expiated or interred. Indeed, expiation and exorcism of any place, and also the sacred rite of burial being correctly used to bodies, often prohibits the approach of souls themselves and repels them far from places of judgment.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Hence, necromancy has its name because it operates on corpses and desires responses from the shades and manes of the dead, as well as subterranean daemons. It draws them into the corpses by certain stygian songs, infernal invocations, funerary sacrifices, and impious offerings. For instance, we read from Lucan of that witch Erichtho, 
who summoned the dead and predicted to Sextus Pompey all of the events of the Pharsalian war.#t_footnote(<nt2572>, "nr2572")[5] Also in Phigalia, a city in Arcadia, there were certain magicians, skilled priests in sacred rites, who could summon souls to life.#t_footnote(<nt2573>, "nr2573")[6] 
The holy scriptures testify that a certain female sorceress summoned the soul of Samuel.#t_footnote(<nt2574>, "nr2574")[7] Also, the souls of saints certainly love their bodies and often hear more readily where the symbols of their relics are protected.

  #p_normal[
    There are two kinds of necromancy: one [called] necromancy, which raises corpses, and is not done without blood; and the other [called] scyomancy, in which only summoning the shade suffices.#t_footnote(<nt2575>, "nr2575")[8] Finally, they work all of their experiments with the corpses, bones, and members of the slaughtered, and what is from them, because there is a daemonic power friendly to these [parts]. Therefore, they easily attract wicked daemonic influences, because of a likeness and a great familiar quality. With these, the necromancer, relying on their works, can do very much in terrestrial and human things, kindling forbidden loves, causing dreams, sickness, hatred, passions, and the like. Then they can also bring the powers of these souls, thus far being enveloped in a humid and turbulent spirit, wandering about their cast off [bodies], the same as what wicked daemons commit.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, because from experience these avengers of wickedness have learned that perverse and impure souls violently wrested away from their bodies, and men not expiated and without burial, linger around their bodies and are drawn to them by affinity. They draw unhappy souls by the acquisition of their bodies, or by taking some part of it. Then by compelling them with stygian invocations,#t_footnote(<nt2576>, "nr2576")[9] they implore through the formless corpses dispersed through open fields, wandering shades who are without a burial, corpses sent back to Acheron and guests of hell, whose untimely death were carried off to Tartarus, and by the horrible desires of damned and arrogant daemons.#t_footnote(<nt2577>, "nr2577")[10]

    Those who would truly restore souls to their bodies must know the particular nature of the soul: from where it emerged; by how much and how many degrees of perfection it is full; which intelligence strengthens it; by what medium it diffuses in the body; with what harmony it can be bound together with; what affinity it has with God, the intelligences, the heavens, the elements, and all other things whose image and likeness it holds; and finally what influence joins it to the body.#t_footnote(<nt2578>, "nr2578")[11]

    It must be noted that it sometimes happens to men that their vivifying spirit is withdrawn and appears dead and unfeeling. [Under such circumstances,] the intellectual nature remains united with the body, has the same form, and remains in the same body. [In such cases,] the vivifying power does not actually continue in it, but remains withdrawn in union with the intellectual nature. Yet it does not cease to be. Although a man [in that condition] can be said to be truly dead (inasmuch as death is the absence of life) that body may not be truly separated and can be awakened and come to life again.

  #p_normal[
    The human soul consists of mind, reason, and idolum.#t_footnote(<nt2582>, "nr2582")[1] The mind illuminates reason, from reason emanates imagination, and all is one soul. Reason, unless it is illuminated by mind, is not immune from error: but the mind does not give light to reason unless enlightened by God—that is, the first light.#t_footnote(<nt2583>, "nr2583")[2] Indeed, the first light in God stands above all understanding, which is why it cannot be called an intelligible light. But that light, when infused in the mind, can be made intellectual and be understood. Then, when reason is infused by the mind, it is made rational and not only able to be intelligent but also cognizant. Then when the idolum is infused by reason, the soul is not only made cognizant but also imaginable, yet still less corporeal. However, when it moves in the ethereal vehicle of the soul, it is at first made corporeal (though not clearly perceptible) until it crosses over in an elemental body (whether simple and airy, or a compound body) in which the light is clearly made visible to the eye.

    Considering this progress of light, Chaldean philosophers speak of a certain astounding power of our mind. [This power] is, of course, made possible because our mind—if the entire acuity is fixed on God— will be filled with divine light. Thus, filled with light, its rays will be diffused to each medium: even to the densest, darkest, heaviest mortal bodies, surrounding them with the most plentiful light, and making them like the stars, equally shining. Then, also with the abundance and lightness of its rays, it lifts them high just like straw elevating from the flame of fire.#t_footnote(<nt2584>, "nr2584")[3] Sometimes it can immediately move the body as a spirit to remote parts, as we read of Philip in Acts of the Apostles when he baptized a eunuch in India and was immediately found in Azotus; and likewise of Habacuc from Daniel.

    This same virtue is in every man and is in the human soul from the root of his creation. It varies in different men in its strength, weakness, increase, and decrease.

    Al-Kindi, [Roger] Bacon, and William of Auvergne called this the sense of nature, Virgil called it the ethereal sense, and Platonists called it the vehicle of sense.#t_footnote(<nt2588>, "nr2588")[7] Thoughts are made stronger when that ethereal and celestial virtue is poured over them, whose splendor comforts them, until the species, notions, and true understanding of things are apprehended. Thus, what one thinks in his mind comes into being just as he thought, and arrives with such a great power that it can immerse, join, and insinuate itself into the minds of men. [In doing this, that spelendor can] make them certain of his thoughts, will, and desire. [One] also comprehends with their senses present objects through great and remote spaces and can cause many things in little time as if they were done without time. This is not given to everyone but rather to those whose imaginative and cogitative virtues are strong and who arrive at the limit of speculation. It is appropriate to apprehend and declare everything by the splendor of the universal virtue or intelligence, and the spiritual apprehension that is over them. This is a necessary virtue that anyone who follows the truth should follow and must obey.#t_footnote(<nt2589>, "nr2589")[8]

    Now, therefore, if the virtue of the imagination is so great that it can insinuate itself into what it wishes, not impeded or prohibited by either place or interval of time, and in whatever direction it dreams or imagines, it can sometimes drag its heavy body along with it. There is no doubt that the power of the mind is greater if at any time it takes its own nature and is not burdened by allurements, persevering uncorrupted, and is like itself.

    Here are some examples: Souls abound with such a plentiful light of the celestial stars that an abundant light overflows in great abundance from their bodies. Thus, Moses’s face shone so that the children of Israel could not look at him because of the splendor of his face;#t_footnote(<nt2590>, "nr2590")[9] thus, we read that Socrates was transfigured so that he conquered the light-bringing wheels of the Sun;#t_footnote(<nt2591>, "nr2591")[10] thus, Zoroaster transformed and his body was lifted up; thus, Enoch and Elijah ascended to heaven in a certain fiery chariot; thus, Paul was taken up to the third heaven; thus, our bodies after the judgment of the world, which is then called glorified, and likewise taken up and we can say for this reason will shine like the Sun and Moon.#t_footnote(<nt2592>, "nr2592")[11]

The father of Theodorus was also said to pour out sparks from his entire body, and a certain wise man was said to pour out sparks that had sounds.

    The mind is above fate in providence: it is neither affected by influences of the celestial bodies, nor natural qualities. Therefore, only religion heals it. The idolum of the soul is in fate, and above nature, which is a certain node of the body and soul. [This node is] under fate but over the body.

    What I call the “idolum” of the soul is that vivifying and rectifying power of the body, the origin of the senses by which the soul itself unfolds its powers of perception in this body. It senses corporeal things through the body, moves the body through a place, rules in the place, and nourishes the body in a body.

    There are two most powerful dominating virtues in this idolum.#t_footnote(<nt2595>, "nr2595")[14] The first one is called fantasy, imaginative virtue, or thought, of whose power I have already spoken regarding the passions of the mind.#t_footnote(<nt2596>, "nr2596")[15] The other virtue is what is called the sense of nature, of which we have also spoken, where we made mention of haruspices.#t_footnote(<nt2597>, "nr2597")[16]

    Therefore, man, by the nature of his body, is under fate. The soul of man moves nature in fate by its idolum, thus the mind is above fate in order of providence. Reason, however, is free by its own law. Therefore, the soul, in this way, follows the manner of those parts: sometimes it ascends in the mind through reason, where it is filled by divine light, and sometimes it descends into the idolum, where it is affected by the influences of the celestial bodies and qualities of natural things. [When it descends thus into the idolum,] the meeting of sensible passions distracts it. Sometimes the soul returns itself entirely into reason, searches out other things with arguments, or contemplates itself.#t_footnote(<nt2598>, "nr2598")[17] Indeed, it is possible that this part of the rational soul, which the Peripatetics called the possible intellect, can arrive at [such a state] that it can freely discourse and operate without conversion to phantoms.#t_footnote(<nt2599>, "nr2599")[18] Finally, so great is the command of this reason that as often as something meets either in the mind, idolum, nature, or body, it cannot pass over to the soul unless reason intends itself to it. In this way, the soul does not perceive itself by seeing, hearing, and feeling, nor [does the soul] allow itself to perceive by external senses until contemplative reason first conceives it. [The soul] comprehends when it is idle, and not when it is concerned with other things, as we can plainly see in those who do not notice someone because they are thinking more diligently of something else.#t_footnote(<nt2600>, "nr2600")[19]

    Therefore, know that neither supernal influences, natural affections, sensations, passions either of the body or soul, nor whatever is sensible, can drive or penetrate the soul, unless by the judgment of reason itself. Thus, by its actions, not by outside violence, [reason] can either influence or disturb the soul, which also innumerable martyrs have proved. The philosopher Anasarchus from Abdera, by the command of the tyrant Nicocreon from Cyprus, was thrown into a concave stone. While he was struck with iron mallets, he neglected the punishments of his body and said: “Beat, beat the vessel of Anasarchus: nothing will frighten me.” The tyrant ordered that [Anasarchus’s] tongue be cut off, and with [Anasarchus’s] own teeth he bit it off and spat it out in the face of the tyrant.#t_footnote(<nt2601>, "nr2601")[20]

    Chapter 44. Of the degrees of souls and their perishing or immortality.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    The mind, because it is from God or perhaps the intelligible world, is therefore immortal and eternal. Reason is long-lived because of the benefit of its celestial origin from heaven, but the idolum,#t_footnote(<nt2602>, "nr2602")[1] because it is from the bosom of matter and depends on sublunary nature, is subjected to ruin and corruption. Therefore, the soul through its mind is immortal. The reason for this is that, although the soul is long-lived in its ethereal vehicle, it is dissolvable unless it is restored the circuit of a new body. Therefore, the soul is not immortal unless it is united with the immortal mind. Thus, the idolum of the soul—that is, the part called the “sensitive” or “animal” soul, because it is drawn from the bosom of corporeal matter—is dissolved with the body and perishes together with it, or in some cases the shadow remains not long afterward in the vapors of the dissolved body. [The idolum] shares nothing with immortality unless it is likewise united with a more sublime power.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, when the mind is united with the soul, it is called the “standing” soul, rather than “falling.”#t_footnote(<nt2603>, "nr2603")[2] However, not all men attain this mind. This is because, as Hermes said, God the Father wished to display it as a contest and prize for souls. Those who neglect it, being without mind, surrender [themselves to their] corporeal senses#t_footnote(<nt2604>, "nr2604")[3] and become like irrational animals and are appointed to the same destruction as them. As it said in Ecclesiastes: “There the destruction of men and beasts is one, and the condition of both are equal: as man dies, thus they also die; likewise, they all breathe and man has nothing more than beasts.”#t_footnote(<nt2605>, "nr2605")[4]

    Hence, many theologians think souls of this kind have no continuing immortality after the death of the body, except for only a hope of resurrection when all men are restored anew. Augustine wrote that this was a heresy of the Arabs, who likewise say that the soul perishes with the body and in judgment rises again with them.#t_footnote(<nt2606>, "nr2606")[5]

  #p_normal[
    However, Hermes said that those who are supported by divine grace receive a mind [as a gift] and become immortal according to the combination of their works, embracing all things in the earth, sea, and heavens by their understanding, and even that which lies above heaven, so that they will consider goodness itself.#t_footnote(<nt2607>, "nr2607")[6]

    Those who have lived a middling life, who have not obtained a divine intelligence but instead a certain rational image#t_footnote(<nt2608>, "nr2608")[7] of [this intelligence], are banished to certain secret receptacles when they pass from the body. There they are affected by sensible virtues and move about in certain kinds of acts. They either freely rejoice or are gravely hurt by opinions and irascible and concupiscible virtues. St. Augustine also shared this belief and wrote upon it in his book
#emph[Of the Spirit and the Soul].#t_footnote(<nt2609>, "nr2609")[8]

  #p_normal[
    Indian, Persian, Egyptian, and Chaldean wise men handed down [the doctrine] that this soul survives much longer than the body, yet [they held that it is] not immediately made immortal, unless by transcorporation.#t_footnote(<nt2610>, "nr2610")[9] However our theologians philosophize in a far different way: indeed, they say, that even if all souls have a common origin and the same birth,#t_footnote(<nt2611>, "nr2611")[10] they are yet distinguished from each other by the Creator by degrees, not only accidental but also by certain internal degrees rooted in their essence. Each soul is different from the other by that which is individual to itself. Johannes Scotus also held this opinion, and Parisian theologians thus decreed these opinions in their articles. Hence the Wise Man said: “I was an ingenious child and obtained a good soul,” which is much better than many others.

  #p_normal[
    According to this inequality of souls, each is capable of their own duty in their own degree. As we read in the Gospels “One is given five talents, another two, another one, each is given according to their own virtue.” The Apostle also said: “He gave some apostles, others prophets, others preachers and teachers for the perfection of saints, for the ministry of works, for the edification of the body of Christ.”

  #p_normal[
    Indeed there are, as Origen said, certain invisible virtues, which are committed to dispense things over the earth. Just as we find that there is no small difference between one man and another, [we find that the same circumstance exists between these invisible virtues]. Some [men] attain the highest degrees of wisdom or dignities; others somewhat differ from beasts, and grazing beasts are made semi-beasts. Others still overflow with virtues and rich fortunes, while some men have nothing or a little, and what little a man has is often stolen from him and given to one who has. This is the divine justice in the distribution of gifts: they correspond to the virtues of those receiving, to whom rewards are also given according to their works, that what proportion there is of gifts to gifts, and merits to merits, it is also the proportion of rewards to rewards.#t_footnote(<nt2612>, "nr2612")[11]

    Finally, you must know that all noble souls have a fourfold operation: the first is divine by the quality of the divine image; the second is the intellectual by [the soul’s] formality#t_footnote(<nt2613>, "nr2613")[12] of participation with the intelligences; the third is the rational by perfection of its individual essentiality;#t_footnote(<nt2614>, "nr2614")[13] the fourth is the animal or natural by its association to the body and these more inferiors. Thus, there is no work in the whole series of the world that is so admirable, so excellent, and so wonderful, as the human soul embracing its image of divinity. Magicians call this the standing soul and not falling because it cannot accomplish [things] by its own virtue without any outside help. Therefore, the form of every magical virtue is of the soul of man standing and not falling.#t_footnote(<nt2615>, "nr2615")[14]

    Prophecy is when priests or others are enlivened, discern the causes of things, and foresee the future—that is, when oracles and spirits descend and are delivered by gods and daemons. Indeed, Platonists call these descents “the falling of superior souls upon our souls,” and Hermes [Trismegistus] called them the “senses of daemons” and “souls of daemons.”#t_footnote(<nt2616>, "nr2616")[1] Ancients called daemons of this kind #emph[Eurycleis]#t_footnote(<nt2617>, "nr2617")[2] and #emph[Pythones]. The ancients firmly believed that daemons of this kind often entered men’s bodies and used voices and tongues to predict the future. Plutarch remembered this phenomenon in his dialogue #emph[Of the Causes of the Obsolescence of Oracles].#t_footnote(<nt2618>, "nr2618")[3]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Cicero followed the Stoics, affirming that foreknowledge of the future only happens with the gods. The astrologer Ptolemy said: “Only those inspired by the divine can foretell particular things.” Peter the apostle supported this, saying: “Indeed, prophecy does not come from the will of man at any time, but the Holy Spirit inspires the speaking of holy men of God.” Isaiah affirmed that prophecy of the future is the descent of particular gods and the divine, saying: “Report to us those things to come, and we will tell them because you are gods.”#t_footnote(<nt2619>, "nr2619")[4] However, descents of this kind or senses do not pass over into our souls when they are more diligently occupied in something else. Rather, they pass into [our souls] when [they are] unoccupied. There are three kinds of vacancies of this sort: frenzy, rapture, and dreams. We will now speak of each in order.

    Plato defined this as an aversion and a binding. Accordingly, he abstracted from those by which the corporeal senses are excited.

It holds back none of the urges of its impulses and is stirred by a divine spirit. Comprehending everything, it foresees the future.

#emph[Commentaries on Leviticus] that there is an animal called an #emph[iedua,] ידוע, that has a human form with a thin cord coming from the middle of its navel.

Because it deceives the sight, it cannot be captured unless the cord is cut by the blow of an arrow, and when cut, it dies.

    The sixth level responds to Jupiter. This holds reasonable discourse, deliberations, consultations, and moral purifications. Part of this we mentioned above, and part we will speak of later. It also contains under itself admirations and venerations. Fantasy and reason are sometimes harnessed by stupefaction as they suddenly overlook all of their actions. Then the mind, being free, is exposed to a divine power, whether a god or some daemon. It thus receives heavenly and divine influences—that is, of what was deliberated before. Thus, we read that the Sibyls and priests of Pythia often received oracles in caves of Jupiter and Apollo.

Because [formal things] bear the effigies#t_footnote(<nt2636>, "nr2636")[17] of the heavenly divine powers and invoked spirits, they easily draw and impel them by a certain necessity of conformity to agree, and also hinder them so that they will not easily retreat.

    The second frenzy comes from Dionysus. Through outer and inner expiations, exorcisms, sacraments, solemnities, rites, sanctuaries, and observations, it directs the soul into the mind,#t_footnote(<nt2638>, "nr2638")[1] the more supreme part of itself. [The mind] is made a worthy and unpolluted temple for the gods, which the divine spirits can inhabit. The soul[, when directed into the mind,] possesses it as the associate of life, filling it with happiness, wisdom, and oracles. [This is accomplished] not in signs, marks, or conjectures, but with a certain passion of the soul and an unbound and free motion: thus Bacchus prophesied to the Boeotians, Epimenides to the Cretans,#t_footnote(<nt2639>, "nr2639")[2] and the Sibyl Erytrea to the Trojans.

    Sometimes this frenzy takes hold with a clear vision, sometimes by a distinct voice:#t_footnote(<nt2640>, "nr2640")[3] thus Socrates was ruled by his daemon, whose advice he carefully obeyed, whose voice he repeatedly heard with his ears, and who also appeared in the form of a daemon.#t_footnote(<nt2641>, "nr2641")[4] Indeed, prophetic spirits often allow themselves to be visible and accompany well-cleansed souls, of which there are many examples in the holy scriptures—Abraham with his slave Hagar, Jacob, Gideon, Elijah, Tobias, Daniel, and many others.#t_footnote(<nt2642>, "nr2642")[5]

All who were near him were dumbfounded. Histories relate of a certain Egyptian named Heraiscus who was endowed with a certain divine nature so that if only seeing a likeness that had some divine power, was immediately moved into a prophetic frenzy. We likewise read in the holy scriptures that when Saul was among prophets, the spirit of the Lord leaped into him and he prophesied, and that whenever he departed from the crowd of prophets he ceased to prophesy. The same happened when Saul sent those attendants to capture David; who, when he saw the crowd of prophets and Samuel standing over them, acquired the spirit of the Lord and also prophesied to them.#t_footnote(<nt2649>, "nr2649")[4] So great is this extraordinary divine light that prophets are often seized in divine frenzy so that it also seizes those near them and are likewise compelled by a spirit of frenzy.#t_footnote(<nt2650>, "nr2650")[5]

    As Apuleius testified, the human mind also can by a certain sacred avocation and ingratiation, be lulled to sleep and be frightened so that it would forget the present, especially if simple and pure.

    Iamblichus said: “When the prophets are inspired with the will of the gods, they fear nothing, and they dread nothing: for they rush through impassible ways and carry fire without injury and cross rivers.” Thus we read of certain caves, tripods,#t_footnote(<nt2652>, "nr2652")[7] hollows, fountains, lakes, and the like, such as of Apollo and Trophonius, which were consecrated to the gods in this manner, or were made by that mystery.#t_footnote(<nt2653>, "nr2653")[8] From these, priests could drink from the spirit of prophecy, just as Iamblichus wrote to Porphyry: “The Sibyl in Delphi often receives the god in a twofold way; indeed, by a delicate spirit and fire, which rushed forth somewhere from the mouth of the cave; either seated at the entrance on a brazen tripod devoted to the god, but in either case she was driven by that divine spirit, pouring forth predictions. Then a great fire from the entrance surrounded her from every side, and there filled her with divine powers, or adhered to the sacred seat through which the god influenced her to immediately erupt in prophecies. However, the prophetess in Branchidae#t_footnote(<nt2654>, "nr2654")[9] who sat either on an axle or held a staff in her hand that was given to her by some deity, sometimes either washing her feet or the border of her robe in water or drinking waves of vapor from the fire.

    We also read that in the region of Thrace, there was a sanctuary sacred to Liber,#t_footnote(<nt2656>, "nr2656")[11] from where predictions and oracles were often made, and whose temple priests drank sufficient wine to agitate things. Also at Claros, there was a temple to Clarian Apollo, where they were permitted to utter divine things, having first drunk water#t_footnote(<nt2657>, "nr2657")[12] to complete things.#t_footnote(<nt2658>, "nr2658")[13] There is also a prophetic fountain in Patras#t_footnote(<nt2659>, "nr2659")[14] Achaea placed before the temple of Ceres, where those inquiring about the sick would approach, holding a mirror with a string tied to it, sent [the mirror] away [with the string] to the highest fountain in the water. When finished, they offered certain prayers and fumigations and they could see the outcome of the [sick person’s health]. Also, not far from Epidaurus, is the city Laconia with a deep swamp called “the water of Juno,” into which cakes of grain were cast for answers: [these were interpreted as being] positive if, when the cakes were thrown in, the waves calmly retained them; the opposite if [the waves] repulsed them as if despising them. Also similar are the caves of Aetna, as frequently named, into which coins or victims were thrown to presage happiness or sadness by whether the caves retained what is thrown in or rejected the offering.#t_footnote(<nt2660>, "nr2660")[15] Similar things were narrated by Dio in his
#emph[Roman History] of the place called the Nympheum, where frankincense was placed in flames and oracles were taken hold, and spoke about everything one wishes to know, except those things concerning the dead and marriage.#t_footnote(<nt2661>, "nr2661")[16] Likewise, wonderful is what Aristotle wrote of a fountain in Palici of Sicily, to which those approaching affirmed some vow, threw a tablet inscribed and sealed with their wishes. If they were honest [the tablets] would be seen to float on the water. However, if the vows were false and they made them deceitfully, [the tablets] would immediately sink. Then flames would suddenly burst forth on the person who swore falsely and burn them to ashes.#t_footnote(<nt2662>, "nr2662")[17] There was likewise an oak in the city of Dodona: as soon as someone entered to receive an answer, it immediately moved and made a sound. Also, in that place, there was a statue holding a staff near a basin (that is, a bowl). [When this statue] was hit, it answered with controlled strikes with the basin.

    The fourth kind of frenzy comes from Venus. This fervent love converts and transmutes the mind into God, making it thoroughly like Him, as it were into its own image of God.#t_footnote(<nt2664>, "nr2664")[1] Of this Hermes said: “O Asclepius, man is a great wonder, an animal that must be honored and adored. Indeed, he passes into the nature of God, where he #emph[is] God; he knows the kinds of daemons, recognizing himself as being born among them; he despises the part of himself that is human nature, confident the other part is divine.”#t_footnote(<nt2665>, "nr2665")[2] Therefore, the soul is likewise converted and made like God. Thus, it is formed from God.#t_footnote(<nt2666>, "nr2666")[3] Above all understanding, it knows all things by a certain essential contact#t_footnote(<nt2667>, "nr2667")[4] with divinity.

    The soul now thus converted into God by love (and raised above the intellectual sphere besides this because of the integrity of its virtue) obtains the spirit of prediction and prophecy. It sometimes also works wonders and greater things than the nature of the world can, which indeed are called miracles. It is just as the heavens act by its image, light, and heat, that the power of fire cannot do by its natural quality. This is even known in alchemy by experience. God also by His image and light can thoroughly bring about [miracles], but the world cannot do so by its own innate virtue. However, the image of God is man, at least as much as man is made like God by a Venusian frenzy. [When this occurs, man] lives only by the mind and entirely receives Jove into his breast.

    Rapture is a separation [and] aversion [of the soul from the body] and [its] enlightenment [thereby]. [This rapture] comes from God, [and] by it God draws the soul that has fallen into the more inferior back to heaven from above.#t_footnote(<nt2671>, "nr2671")[1] The cause of this is a continuous contemplation inside us of the Most High. This happens to the extent that one is aligned with the most profound intention of the mind possible. [The mind] joins with the incorporeal wisdom of the soul, to the extent that it removes itself from the most vehement agitations we receive from the sensible and corporeal. As Plato said, [this happens] in such a way that [the soul] sometimes even flees the body and seems to, as it were, dissolve.#t_footnote(<nt2672>, "nr2672")[2] Thus, Aurelius Augustine wrote of the Calamensian priest, which we remembered above:#t_footnote(<nt2673>, "nr2673")[3] “He lay down like a dead man without breath, and he did not feel when burned or cut.”#t_footnote(<nt2674>, "nr2674")[4]

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, so great is the command of the soul—that is, when it follows its own nature and is not burdened by the allurements of the senses—that by its own power, it suddenly rises while in no way remaining in the body. It is sometimes also unbound from its chains, flying from the body to a supercelestial cohabitation, where it is closest to God and is made as a receptacle to the divine, filled with divine light and oracles. Of this Zoroaster said: “You must ascend to the light itself, and to the rays of the father, from where the soul was sent to you clothed with much mind.” Trismegistus said: “You must rise above the heavens and be far away from the chorus of daemons.” Pythagoras said: “If the body is relinquished, freely passing into the ether, you will be an immortal god.”#t_footnote(<nt2675>, "nr2675")[5]

  #p_normal[
    Thus, we read that Hermes, Socrates, Xenocrates, Plato, Plotinus, Heraclitus, Pythagoras, and Zoroaster were often removed in rapture and thus learned the wisdom of many things. We also read from Herodotus that there was a philosopher in Proconnesos named Aristeas#t_footnote(<nt2676>, "nr2676")[6] who had wonderful knowledge and whose soul sometimes departed his body. After seeing things in remote places, he returned to the body more learned. Pliny delivered something similar, that the soul of Harmonis Clazomenius abandoned his body and wandered, and likewise reported many and true things from far away.#t_footnote(<nt2677>, "nr2677")[7] There is also to this day among the Norwegians and Pilappios,#t_footnote(<nt2678>, "nr2678")[8] very many who can remove themselves for three whole days from their body and report many things from far away. Meanwhile one must guard them so that living animals do not come upon them and contaminate them; otherwise, it is said, they cannot return to their body.

    Therefore, we must know that according to Egyptian doctrine, since the soul is a certain spiritual light, when it is unbound from the body it comprehends every place and every time, not unlike the light enclosed in a lantern. If opened, it is diffused everywhere and does not fail, for it is everywhere and always is.#t_footnote(<nt2679>, "nr2679")[9] And Cicero in his book 
#emph[On Divination] said: “The soul of man never divines, unless when it is completely unbound it has nothing or little to do with the body.”#t_footnote(<nt2680>, "nr2680")[10] Therefore, when it comes to that state which is the supreme degree of contemplative perfection, it is then snatched from every created species and is not understood by acquired species but instead by the inspection of Ideas and it understands all things by the light of Ideas; of which light Plato said few men can partake in this life, but all are better with the gods.#t_footnote(<nt2681>, "nr2681")[11]

    Also, those who faint and have epilepsy sometimes imitate rapture, and just like a rapture, predictions sometimes emerge; of these kinds of predictions, we read that Hercules and many Arabs were excellent.#t_footnote(<nt2682>, "nr2682")[12] And there are certain prophecies, which are a middle between the confines of natural divination and transnatural oracles—that is, those from some excessive passion such as too much love, sadness, among repeated sighs, or proclaim the agony of a future death, as Statius said of the mother of Achilles:

    Indeed, there is a certain evident power and capability of all things in our mind, but it is impeded and obstructed by the darkness and mortality of the body. But after death, having attained immortality and being unbound from the body, it has full and perfect knowledge. Hence it happens that those near death and weakened by old age sometimes have a somewhat unaccustomed light, because the soul is then less shackled by the senses and understands most acutely, and now is, as it were, slightly relaxed from its chains. It is no longer entirely liable to the body and, as it were, closer to the place to which it was going, easily perceiving revelations, which, being mixed with its agonies, are offered to it.#t_footnote(<nt2684>, "nr2684")[14] Of this Ambrose in his book 
#emph[On the Belief of the Resurrection] said: “Our soul is eager to evade that same corporeal prison, which being free from areal motion does not know ‘where it goes or from where it comes.’ Yet we know that the soul can survive the body, and there being freed with the cloak of its senses thrown off, can contemplate to discern those things which it could not see before in the body. We can estimate this from an example of those who sleep: with their mind quiet, their bodies are as is as if buried. They raise themselves to the higher and report to the body visions of things absent or even the celestial.”#t_footnote(<nt2685>, "nr2685")[15]

    Now what I call a dream is that which comes from the spirit of fantasy and the intellect, united together either by the enlightenment of the acting intellect over our soul#t_footnote(<nt2686>, "nr2686")[1] or by the bare revelation of some divine will#t_footnote(<nt2687>, "nr2687")[2] with a purged and tranquil mind. Indeed, our soul receives true oracles from this and sufficiently gives oracles to us. In dreams, we seem to ask, learn, gather, and discover; likewise, many doubtful things, many deliberations, many unknown and unexpected things, nor ever attempted by our minds, are revealed in our dreams. The images of unknown places appear. The likenesses of men both alive and dead [appear]. Predictions of the future and things that have happened are revealed, making known what has not been reported.#t_footnote(<nt2688>, "nr2688")[3] These dreams do not need any art of interpretation of which we have spoken in the first book, which is divination rather than foreknowledge.

  #p_quote[
    #emph[From where dreams are taken and understood.]

  #p_normal[
    It happens that those who see [these dreams] do not understand them, because—as Abdala the Arab said—since seeing dreams is from the power of imagination, thus understanding them is from the power of understanding.#t_footnote(<nt2689>, "nr2689")[4] Therefore, those sleepers whose intellect is too greatly immersed in the commerce of flesh (or whose imaginative or fantastical spirit is so sluggish or rough) cannot receive the influences and images of the divine intellect’s appearances and retain what is received. These men are completely useless for prophecies from dreams.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, if one wishes to receive true dreams, they must keep a pure, unshaken, and undisturbed fantastical spirit. Thus composed, their mind is made worthy, and the intellect can preside and become known: for such a spirit is most apt for prophecy. As Synesius said, [that state of mind is] the clearest mirror of images flowing from all things.#t_footnote(<nt2690>, "nr2690")[5] Therefore, when we are of sound body, the soul not confused, not burdened with food and drink, nor one grieving over poverty, and no sin of lust or passion roaring within us, but instead chastely falling to sleep, then our pure and divine soul is unbound from all harmful thoughts. It is now free for dreaming, relying on that instrument of the divine spirit, radiating and gleaming from the divine mind, receiving rays and effigies into itself, and just as if it were a certain deifying mirror, the contemplation of understanding all common investigations and rational discourse is indeed far more certain, clearer, and more effective. The instructing divine powers invite those souls into their group by the opportunity of their nocturnal solitude. Moreover, that divinity will not fail to act as a guide when awake.

    Therefore, whoever [pursues] quiet and religious meditation as well as a temperate and moderate diet according to nature preserves his pure spirit.

They are deceived and blunted, just like someone who is blind in one eye.#t_footnote(<nt2691>, "nr2691")[6] Their debility causes a confused and indistinct judgment. As when we are drunk and filled with wine, our spirit is then oppressed with noxious vapors.

    Hence it was customary among the ancients that those who wished to receive answers would first celebrate with certain sacred expiations and sacrifices, and when the divine worship was completed, they would lie down in a consecrated bedroom, or at least on the fleece of the religious sacrifice.

Should your mother, brothers, and I worship you upon the earth”? Indeed, the result of this was that his mother died shortly afterward because she did not follow them. Rabbi Johanen also mentioned this in the book mentioned above, and Rabbi Levi added that all prophetic dreams cannot be cheated of their effects for more than twentytwo years: thus, Joseph dreamed in his seventeenth year what was later accomplished in his thirty-ninth year of age.#t_footnote(<nt2699>, "nr2699")[14]

    Therefore, those wishing to receive divine dreams must have a welldisposed body, the brain free from vapors, the mind from disturbances, and abstain that day from dinner and drink that can intoxicate.

    There are also certain lots possessing a divine virtue of oracles and are, as it were, indicators of divine judgment.

there was once an oracle of Hercules that consisted of a tablet and dice. Those

    You must know that the ancient fathers did not often cast lots for any slight cause, but either because of necessity or a great urgent need, and did not summon them without great reverence, respect, expiations, fasting, purity, prayers, invocations, vows, sacrifices, consecrations, and other religious sacred mysteries. Indeed, these sacred rites were often made before their works so that they would especially provoke divine goodwill, benevolence, and the presence of the divine spirits, to whose dispensation the lots were directed to receive a true opinion to things that were asked.

In addition, he must have strong purity, chastity, and sanctity toward God and the heavens, and have undoubted hope and a firm faith, and invoke with sacred orations, so that they are made worthy of meeting divine spirits and knowing divine will. For if you are thus disposed, the virtue of the lots will reveal great secrets to you and will become a true prophet [knowing] the past, present, and future of what is required.

    But what we have said here concerning lots must be observed in the marks of all auguries—that is, with fear yet with a firm expectation.

At Pharis, a city in Achaea, there was once a likeness of Mercury in the middle of the market, where omens were taken. Fumigations of frankincense and lit lamps were placed before it, and the country’s coin was offered to the likeness’s right hand. Then whatever was inquired was whispered in the ear of the likeness, and immediately afterward [the inquirer] stopped both ears with his hands, and he swiftly ran from the market.

    Therefore, although these kinds of lots seem to be as casual, accidental events, and unreasonable to the ignorant, yet they are disposed by God and the more sublime virtues by a certain reason.

    Indeed, this happened so impulsively that this was certainly not of the human mind but of divine inspiration—that is to say, that God is in all works. God transfers himself into holy souls and sets up prophets and workers of miracles who are powerful in works and speeches. Just as Plato, Mercury, and Xystus the Pythagorean asserted, these kinds of men are the temple of God, in which God is the guest. Our Paul agreed that man is called the temple of God, and elsewhere spoke of himself: “I can do all things in him who strengthens me”; indeed, God Himself is our strength, without whom nothing is possible.

    One must come to this purity of mind gradually and by certain degrees. One who is newly initiated into each of the mysteries cannot comprehend all lucid things. Their mind must become gradually accustomed, until their intellect can project and thoroughly mix with the divine light.#t_footnote(<nt2718>, "nr2718")[8] Therefore, when the soul is correctly purged, expiated from human affairs, and then freed from all blemishes, it can leap outside and move freely, ascending upwards, capturing the divine. [Under such circumstances, it can] also teach itself, when perhaps it seems it was educated elsewhere. Indeed, it does not need to remember or demonstrate [this knowledge] by natural skill and by their mind, which is the head and helmsman of the soul.

    Inasmuch as external cleanliness is believed by no small [number of people] to help the purity of the mind, we must therefore especially observe cleanliness in diet, works, and dispositions. [It is necessary] to expel all filth and disturbances from the mind: this includes anything that offends sense and spirit, and those things in man#t_footnote(<nt2723>, "nr2723")[1] that are dissimilar to the heavens. This applies not only if these disturbances are in the mind or spirit but also whether they are in or around the body.#t_footnote(<nt2724>, "nr2724")[2] For this reason, Pythagorean philosophers who were taken by a keen desire for oracles first being celebrated with divine praises, then washed in the river or a bath, afterward dressing themselves in white and linen garments. [They clothed themselves in this way because] they thought that wool is a profane garment. This was because they rejected the filth of the excrements of beasts and felt it was necessary to live in a pure and absolutely immaculate room in order to obtain the oracles they wanted.

    In a similar way, the wise Brahmans#t_footnote(<nt2725>, "nr2725")[3] of India often washed without clothes in a fountain called Dirce in Boeotia, first daubing amber#t_footnote(<nt2726>, "nr2726")[4] drops and suitable scents on their head. Then after they were sufficiently clean according to the rites, they emerged at about noon, with bright linen garments, a white turban, with rings and their fingers, and bearing rods in their hands. In a similar way among the Gymnosophists, it was ordained that they wash in cold water three times in the day, and twice at night, before entering sacred sanctuaries; they also wore linen garments that they washed daily.

    Indeed, a man thus clean is compared to the celestials, becomes spiritual, and is as such disposed to the contemplation and union with God, because God attends a clean body and pure mind.

    The cleanliness of all of this also purifies the air and attracts the cleanest of the celestial and divine influences. It allures and converts the clean ministers of God and good daemons. However, sometimes also unclean spirits and evil daemons, as the apes of good [daemons], seek out this kind of cleanness so that they can be adored and deceive.

    Abstinence likewise intimately fortifies and protects its observers everywhere against vice and evil daemons. It makes the mind an unpolluted temple of God#t_footnote(<nt2732>, "nr2732")[1] and connects it with the mind of God. Nothing is better for health and temperance of the complexion than bringing together fewer superfluities, and not exceeding the necessary limits of nourishment. Indeed, nourishment should not be taken that is stronger for nature, but rather the nature should be stronger, just as many affirm that Christ accepted food in the [correct] proportion so that it did not generate a superfluous fourth digestion.#t_footnote(<nt2733>, "nr2733")[2] Likewise, many others who were unwilling to eat enjoyed health and active bodies: these included Moses and Elijah, who fasted for as long as forty days; this is why the face [of Moses] shone and could easily guide his body as if it were a spirit.#t_footnote(<nt2734>, "nr2734")[3]

  #p_normal[
    Wise men and philosophers assert that our spirit is not as an earthly thing, or a body with digestion for certain organs to receive some nourishment from food and drink but draws its nourishment through every side of its body like a sponge—namely, by thin vapors penetrating the body from all sides. Therefore, those who desire to have this spirit be pure and powerful, should use drier foods and make this dense body thin with fasting, and make it easily permeable, lest, by that weight, the spirit will thicken and suffocate. Then they should preserve a clean body by washing, massage, exercise, and clothing and should strengthen the spirit by sacred purifications and suffumigations and bring it to a pure and thin integrity. Therefore, we must accept pure foods and be abstinent, just as Pythagorean philosophers (who kept a sacred and sober table) prolonged their life by temperance.

    Indeed, a tempered life and complexion, because no dominant humor brings commotion to us so that fantasy can disrupt some image, makes our soul always subjected to heavenly influences, often while dreaming, but also sometimes while awake.#t_footnote(<nt2735>, "nr2735")[4] In addition, Pythagoreans promise perpetual health for all and a long life if one can wisely moderate their mind, body, and motions by abstinence. Thus, Brahmans do not admit any to their college, unless they abstain from wine, meat, and sin, saying no one can understand God unless they emulate God by their way of life, which indeed Phraotes from Philostratus taught lower Indians.#t_footnote(<nt2736>, "nr2736")[5]

For this reason, Athenian priests, whom the Greeks call “Hierophants” as Jerome reported, often castrated themselves by drinking hemlock so that they could live more chastely in sacred acts and divine things.#t_footnote(<nt2739>, "nr2739")[8] Also, the chastity of a mind devoted to God, as Orpheus taught the Musaeus in the

#emph[Tusculan Disputations] called these passions an “affliction” and “pestilential sickness of the mind.”#t_footnote(<nt2742>, "nr2742")[11] Horace called them a “passion” or “insanity,” where he sang: #emph[A thousand passions for girls and boys.]#t_footnote(<nt2743>, "nr2743")[12]

    Therefore we must strip and avert our mind from all the many inner passions of this sort so that they can attain the simplest truth. We read that many philosophers attained [truth] while in solitude for a long time.#t_footnote(<nt2746>, "nr2746")[15] Indeed, the mind is loosed by solitude from all of the cares of human toils and causes it to think daily about what the celestial divinities think.#t_footnote(<nt2747>, "nr2747")[16] Thus, when Moses—the Hebrew law-giver and greatest of prophets, who was learned in all of the wisdom of the Chaldeans and Egyptians—wished to withdraw himself from his senses, he went into the vast solitudes of Ethiopia. There, in a place where every human toil was omitted, he turned his intellect and mind exclusively toward the contemplation of divine things. This pleased the omnipotent God, so that [Moses] merited seeing Him face-to-face. Moses also received the astounding power of miracles in this way, which are testified in the holy scriptures.#t_footnote(<nt2748>, "nr2748")[17]

    Thus, Zoroaster—the father and prince of magicians—is said to have received the knowledge of all natural and divine things through a solitude of twenty years, where he wrote and did many things of the arts of divination and prophecy.

We read also that Epimenides of Crete was educated from a certain very long dream: they say he slept for fifty years, [an allegorical story that] they understand [to mean he] lay hidden. Likewise, Pythagoras is said to have lain hidden for ten years,#t_footnote(<nt2749>, "nr2749")[18] and Heraclitus and Democritus for the same reason were delighted with solitude.#t_footnote(<nt2750>, "nr2750")[19] Indeed, it is in propotion to how much we relinquish the animal and human life that we live with angels and God, with whom we are united and are restored into a better fate.

  #p_normal[
    Our mind is to be segregated from animal life, every multitude, and to be raised until it ascends to the very one, good, truth, and beauty, through each that is to such an extent knowable. These are known by degrees, as Proclus taught in
#emph[Commentary on Alcibiades,] showing how the perceptible should especially be avoided, that we can be transferred to an incorporeal essence. We must surpass the order of souls, yet multiplied by many methods, conditions, and various proportions, and many chains, and a manifold variety of powers, and to strive for an intellect and intelligible kingdom, and to contemplate how much better an interval these are than minds. We must also abandon an intellectual multitude, although united and individual, and come to the superintellectual and essential unity, free from every multitude and every fountain of good and truth. For a similar reason, we must avoid all knowledge that distracts and deceives (which can happen in many ways) so that we can follow the simplest truth.

  #p_normal[
    Therefore, relinquish the multitude of affections, senses, imaginations, and opinions, which are as different themselves as some are contrary to others. We must ascend to knowledge, in which although there might be a varying multitude, there is yet no contrariety. Indeed, everything is connected to everything else, and each part of this unity ministers and serves the others by turns. [This essential interconnection extends] all the way to the One, presupposed by all, supposing nothing beyond it, to which all other things must be referred.
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Yet this is not the highest point of knowledge. Above it is the pure intellect. Therefore, leaving all composed, divided, and multiform discourse aside, we shall ascend to the intellectual life and simplest intuition, beholding the intelligible essence with individual and simple perceptions, that we can reach the highest existence of souls, by which we are one, and under which our multitude is united. Thus, we will finally attain the First One, from where all unities begin, which through that unity we can, as it were, touch the flower of our essence.

    Therefore it must be explained that thoughts and affections of the mind, and every evil that comes from our heart and mouth, must be confessed to a priest, so that he can judge us according to the Word of God.

    There is yet another sacrament of expiation called alms, of which I remember reading very little or nothing from philosophers, but the highest Truth has been taught to us, saying: “Give alms and all things will be clean to you.” From Ecclesiasticus we read: “As water extinguishes fire, thus alms extinguish sin.” Daniel taught the king of Babylon that he could atone for his sins by alms, and the angel Raphael testified to Tobias that alms free from death, purge sins, and make us find eternal life. Hence, Christ commanded that we pray to the Father: “Forgive as we forgive and give as we give,” and He also said elsewhere: “You will receive a hundredfold and possess eternal life”#t_footnote(<nt2758>, "nr2758")[7] [if you give alms].

    It is believed and related by those skilled in sacred things, that the mind can also be expiated by certain traditions and sacraments administered externally, such as by sacrifices, baptisms, exorcisms, blessings, consecrations, and purifications or blessings by the sprinkling of water. Certain anointings and suffumigations are also [understood to accomplish this]. [Skilled acts of this kind] are not as much consecrated, but rather have a natural power: for this reason, sulfur has a place in religions for expiating evil daemons with suffumigations. Likewise, eggs are similarly used for purifications, and hence they are called purificatory eggs. This is why Ovid said:

Due to its purity, ancient priests used it in purifications.#t_footnote(<nt2763>, "nr2763")[3] Likewise, olive branches are said to be of such purity that olive trees planted by courtesans either remain forever unfruitful or will entirely dry up.#t_footnote(<nt2764>, "nr2764")[4] In a similar way, they used frankincense, myrrh, verbena, valerian, and an herb called 
#emph[lucia,] which is also called #emph[phu]#t_footnote(<nt2765>, "nr2765")[5] in Arabic. They also employed the blessed clove flower for purification rites. Similarly, a fumigation with the gall of a black dog is said to be especially excellent for the expiation of the crimes of evil daemons, whatever they were. Likewise, a suffumigation of a hoopoe’s feathers drives away phantasms.

Yet one is not free from danger if it is taken in this way since sudden death follows its extraction unless the person is fortified with an amulet of the same root. If one is without such an amulet, then they should scratch#t_footnote(<nt2767>, "nr2767")[7] a circle in the earth, tie a noose around the root, and tie [the other end] to a dog and then suddenly leave. The dog will follow persistently, attempting to draw out the root as if it were paying for the plight of his master. [The dog] will immediately die, but after this, anyone can handle the root without danger.

When we apply to those deities, we move them so that they can direct us in their speech and answer by divine rays.#t_footnote(<nt2772>, "nr2772")[2] As Dionysius said, God speaks with men by means of these rays, but so secretly that it is scarcely perceptible, and this only by the few.

As Plato said in #emph[Phaedrus,] [the moment we] reach God [is like when] horses stop and enter their stables, where they are fed ambrosia and given nectar to drink.#t_footnote(<nt2777>, "nr2777")[7] Therefore, those who wish to possess some virtue must frequently pray and beseech He who contains the entire virtue in himself. But the best and optimal oration is that which is not made by the mouth but is offered with a sacred silence and an entire understanding of God,#t_footnote(<nt2778>, "nr2778")[8] with each voice of the mind crying out the words of adoration to the gods presiding over the intellectual world.

    A vow is the ardent affection of a chaste mind devoted to God, which longs for that which seems good.#t_footnote(<nt2779>, "nr2779")[9] This disposition, as Iamblichus and Proclus testified, thus connects the soul with God, so that finally the operation of the mind and God are made one. God is the craftsman, and the soul is His divine instrument.#t_footnote(<nt2780>, "nr2780")[10] Thus, sometimes vows make wonders happen, cure illness, and avert storms and the like, as testified by all of the ancients. Hence, we read that the most excellent and wisest men of all nations—the Indian Brahmans, Persian magi, Egyptian Gymnosophists,#t_footnote(<nt2781>, "nr2781")[11] Greek and Chaldean theologians—all sanctioned festivals to the gods and hidden mysteries. They chiefly meditated#t_footnote(<nt2782>, "nr2782")[12] with divine vows and orations and brought about many wonders.

    The perfection of a vow and an adoration—indeed, an adoration without a vow or a vow without an adoration, cannot be wholly perfect—requires two chief things. The first is the inquiry of that which must be adored and vowed, and by what reason, order, and medium it must be worshipped.#t_footnote(<nt2783>, "nr2783")[13] Indeed, there are many cooperators and instruments of God—namely, the heavens, stars, administering spirits, celestial souls, and heroes—which are like doorkeepers, interpreters, administrators, and mediators. Be this as it may, the first god that must be implored is God the archetype, because only He is at the extreme limit of adoration. The other gods are entrances to God Himself.

    Therefore, know that adorations and vows to only one God, the highest Father, King, and Lord of all the gods, must be principally made with a pure and pious mind. However, when [such adorations and vows] are made to the inferior gods, less effort is necessary, unless [those inferiors] are subdelegated by the highest Father for administration.#t_footnote(<nt2784>, "nr2784")[14] Therefore, when adorations and vows are directed to inferior deities, Zoroaster and Orpheus thought it was appropriate to use suffumigations, characters, and the like. However, when making them to the supreme majesty of Jove, very little needs to happen. Hermes and Plato also forbade#t_footnote(<nt2785>, "nr2785")[15] [excessive ritual when invoking that which is most supreme]. For this reason, Hermes said to Tat:#t_footnote(<nt2786>, "nr2786")[16] “It is like a sacrilege when you pray to God, wishing to light frankincense and the like.”#t_footnote(<nt2787>, "nr2787")[17] Indeed, as Porphyry said this is foreign to all piety. Nothing material can be found that is not repulsive to the immaterial God. Therefore, prayer that is made by voice is not appropriate for Him, but neither are inner prayers if the mind is contaminated by sin.#t_footnote(<nt2788>, "nr2788")[18]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    But the second requirement is a certain assimilation of our life with the life of the divine, proceeding in purity, chastity, and sanctity with a lawful desire to what we choose. Indeed, with this, we capture the highest divine benevolence and are subject to divine generosity.#t_footnote(<nt2789>, "nr2789")[19] For, unless our minds are cleansed to make us worthy of being clearly heard and our wishes worthy of being done, it is undoubted that the gods rarely give aid to our prayers. For this reason, the divine Plato said that no prayers or gifts made by the unjust persuade God.#t_footnote(<nt2790>, "nr2790")[20]
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Therefore, we should desire nothing from God that is unbecoming to wish; indeed, for this reason only, we see many prayers and vows frustrated. This is because the people making the prayers are neither religiously disposed, nor are their desires and petitions pleasing to God, nor do they know how to discern the order to adore God and by which mediators they should approach Him. Because of the ignorance of this, our orations and prayers are often reduced to nothing, and our vows and supplications are denied.

    Sacrifice is a kind of offering that makes the offering sacred. It consecrates or sanctifies the one making the offering, unless either irreverence or some other sin impedes it. Therefore, these sacrifices and offerings present much trust to us, make us of the family of God, and repel many imminent evils from us. Indeed, Hebrew teachers confirm this more than others, saying that we sacrifice our animals and dissipate our things by sacrifice, deflecting imminent evils and the like from us.#t_footnote(<nt2791>, "nr2791")[1]

    Moreover, as the mortal priest in this inferior world sacrifices the soul of irrational animals by separating the body from the soul. Thus, the archangel Michael, the priest of the higher world, sacrifices the souls of men by separating the soul from the body. He does not separate the body from the soul, unless by accident such as what happens with frenzy, rapture, ecstasy, dreams, and the like, where souls are free, which the Hebrews call “the kiss of death.”#t_footnote(<nt2792>, "nr2792")[2]

Some are “peaceful” for obtaining peace, some are “praises” for liberation from evil or for the distribution of good, some are “thankful” for acts of divine veneration and grace, indeed some are also made not for the honor or good will of God, such as the sacrifice for jealousy from among the Hebrews, which is only made to expose hidden adultery.#t_footnote(<nt2793>, "nr2793")[3] There was once among the gentiles a sacrifice for expiation, which purged cities from hunger, pestilence, or any horrible work of calamity. These rites were to search in that city to discover the most disgraceful man and to seize and carry him to the appointed place, with him holding in his hands cheese, cakes, and dried figs. There they would flog him seven times with wooden rods. After that, they burned him with that wood and threw his ashes into the sea.#t_footnote(<nt2794>, "nr2794")[4] Lycophron and Hipponax remembered this, and Philostratus narrated something not much different, telling how Apollonius of Tyana chased the plague away in Ephesus.#t_footnote(<nt2795>, "nr2795")[5]

Of this Porphyry said: “Let us strive to offer the sanctity of our life for the sacrifice.”#t_footnote(<nt2859>, "nr2859")[69] Indeed, no one can be a good priest for God unless he presents himself as a sacrifice, builds his own soul, and sets up his mind and intellect as a temple into which he can receive the divine light.

    Now we may see what imprecations#t_footnote(<nt2870>, "nr2870")[1] they added to offerings and sacrifices. Indeed, when they offered or sacrificed to God, they said this or something similar: “I, your servant, offer and sacrifice this to you. I confess that you are the author of sanctity, and I call upon you to sanctify this offering, that you infuse the virtue of your high and honored spirit, that by it I will obtain what I desire. Certainly, your [spirit] being present will affect my offering, that you will make it sacred.” If there is an animal: “Thus as other things live and die by you, thus I am yours. By this offering and communion, for which I come offering and sacrificing to you, I profess to be of your family and your worshipper.” Additionally, in sacrifices, they said: “As this animal is in my power to be slain, or if I wish, to be saved, thus it is in your power to take away in anger or to give in love that which I desire.” Finally, when there is a sacrifice made for an expiation or for avoiding some evil, they said: “As this animal dies by my hand, thus all vice and foulness dies in me,” or “Let such and such evil or ailment die.” Likewise, “As the blood from this animal pours from its body, thus all sin and foulness sheds from me.” In burnt offerings, they said: “As this offering is thus consumed by fire so that nothing remains of it, thus all evil in me will be consumed,” or “Let such and such ailment, which we wish to repel and evade [be consumed].”#t_footnote(<nt2871>, "nr2871")[2] Likewise, it was customary among imprecations to also touch the altar with the hands of all for whom such a sacrifice was made and each of those who wished to participate with it: because an offering cannot be made from prayer alone, unless a prayer is made with hands also touching the altar; from which Virgil sang: #emph[Words of sacrificing.]

    All adorations, offerings, sacrifices, supplications, and invocations are distinguished because they are made either only to God, or to inferior deities, such as angels, stars, and heroes. Accordingly, there are rules that you must observe, that as often as a prayer is offered to God alone for obtaining some effect, it must be done with the remembrance of some work, miracle, sacrament, or a promise taken from the holy scripture. For example, if there is a deprecation for the destruction of enemies, it must be remembered that just as God destroyed the giants in the flood of waters#t_footnote(<nt2874>, "nr2874")[1] and the endeavors of Babel in the confusion of tongues,#t_footnote(<nt2875>, "nr2875")[2] Sodom and Gomorrah in the rain of fire,#t_footnote(<nt2876>, "nr2876")[3] the army of Pharaoh in the Red Sea,#t_footnote(<nt2877>, "nr2877")[4] and the like, adding to these some malediction from the Psalms#t_footnote(<nt2878>, "nr2878")[5] and what can be collected from the holy scriptures.

  #p_normal[
    In a similar way, if we pray against the dangers of water, we must remember the salvation of Noah from the flood,#t_footnote(<nt2879>, "nr2879")[6] the crossing of the children of Israel through the middle of the Red Sea#t_footnote(<nt2880>, "nr2880")[7] and Christ walking with dry feet over the water.

  #p_normal[
    But if it is necessary to pray for an oracle or a dream, either from God, angels, or heroes, many places from the Old Testament offer themselves, where we read that God speaks with men, with very many verses promising presages and revelations. There are also the various prophetic dreams of Jacob,#t_footnote(<nt2882>, "nr2882")[9] Joseph,#t_footnote(<nt2883>, "nr2883")[10] Pharaoh,#t_footnote(<nt2884>, "nr2884")[11] Daniel,#t_footnote(<nt2885>, "nr2885")[12] and Nebuchadnezzar,#t_footnote(<nt2886>, "nr2886")[13] as well as whatever can be found in the New Testament and the Catholic religion [such as] the revelation of John, Paul, holy Magi, then Helen, Constantine, and Charles, then more recent prophets Methodius,#t_footnote(<nt2887>, "nr2887")[14] Cyril, Joachim,#t_footnote(<nt2888>, "nr2888")[15] Merlin, Brigitta,#t_footnote(<nt2889>, "nr2889")[16] Mechtindis,#t_footnote(<nt2890>, "nr2890")[17] Hildegard,#t_footnote(<nt2891>, "nr2891")[18] the names#t_footnote(<nt2892>, "nr2892")[19] of whom are often piously invoked to make us participate in divine revelation.

    In addition, we can also invoke the holy name of God, especially that [aspect of God] that is significative of the thing desired or is likewise appropriate to it in some way. For the destruction of enemies we can invoke with the anger of God, the vengeance of God, the fear of God, the justice of God, and the power of God; for avoiding some danger, we can invoke the names of pity, defense, health, goodness, and the like.

  #p_normal[
    Again, we must petition the executor of that which is desired: whether the angel [of that thing], some star, or one of the heroes on whom that office falls. Our invocation should be directed toward that figure. It must be made with due number, weight, and measure according to the rules delivered, which we have discussed with regard to composing enchantments. Indeed, there is no difference from these except that enchantments affect our mind and dispose those passions into a conformity with certain deities. Prayers are a worship and veneration exhibited to some deity from the same root. The same method of consecration can be accepted, of which we will speak next.

    The effectiveness of consecrations is especially perfected by two things—namely, the virtue of the person [performing] the consecration and the virtue of the prayer and rite that administers the consecration.#t_footnote(<nt2894>, "nr2894")[2] In the person, a purity of life and power of sanctity is required: the first is acquired by the nature and merit; the second by initiation#t_footnote(<nt2895>, "nr2895")[3] and dignification, of which we have spoken elsewhere.#t_footnote(<nt2896>, "nr2896")[4] The one consecrating must also recognize this virtue and power and have a firm and undoubted faith in himself.

    We now intend to speak about those things that are required in prayer. There is a certain power of sanctification divinely engrafted into it, as if it was ordained by God for that purpose. We read the most eloquent explanation of this in the holy scriptures, which was either decided by the virtue of the Holy Spirit according to the ordination of the church, of which there are many more of this kind on record, or this sanctity is in the prayer itself, and not a virtue of the institution, but a remembrance of sacred things, as for example in the holy scriptures, histories, miracles, works, effects, favors, promises, sacraments, and sacramental things, which seem to cling to the consecrated thing whether properly, improperly, or by some similarity. We will now give some examples of this, by which the way can be easily opened for a total consideration of this subject.

    But there is another powerful and very effective rite of consecration and expiation, which are kinds of superstitions—namely, when rites of some sacrament are transmuted to another thing that is intended to be consecrated or expiated, such as rites of baptism, confirmations, funerals, and the like. In addition, we must know that vows, offerings, and sacrifices, which have a certain power of consecration, are nevertheless as real and personal as things or persons that are devoted and offered to certain gods.

    Whatever is called sacred is consecrated by the gods themselves or by their assisting daemons. As I say, such things are dedicated to us by the gods. In this way, we say that daemons are sacred because God dwells in them, and they are often said to bear His name.#t_footnote(<nt2950>, "nr2950")[1] We read in Exodus: “I will send my angel who precedes you.

Thus, the cross is sacred and mysterious, consecrated by the passion of Jesus Christ. Hence, certain orations and prayers are also called sacred and mysterious. They are not instituted by the devotion of men but rather by divine revelation, just as we read in the Gospels that Christ instituted the Lord’s Prayer.#t_footnote(<nt2952>, "nr2952")[3]

    There is another variety of holy things, which we call “sacred.” These are dedicated and consecrated to God by men. They include vows and sacrifices, of which we have spoken above. As we read in Virgil:

For [the likeness] bears the likeness of a man, because the mind altogether produces seminal reason; but he is sculpted sitting, as it imitates a stable and unchangeable virtue; and he has the upper part open and naked, because he is visible to the intelligences and superiors; however, the lower parts are covered, because he is hidden to more inferior creatures; he holds a scepter in his left hand, because in this part of his body can be found the domicile of the most spiritual life, but the creator of the intellect, is the king and vivifying spirit of the world; however, in his right hand he holds out an eagle and victory: [the eagle] because he is the lord of gods, just as an eagle is over other birds, and [victory] because everything is subject to him.#t_footnote(<nt2958>, "nr2958")[9]

In addition, they confer to similar revelations and dreams and are therefore called sacred pictures.

    There are also sacred rites and sacred observations, which are made for the veneration of gods and religions, just as there are devotional gestures, 
genuflections, uncovering of the head, ablutions, sprinkling of holy water, 
fumigations, and outer expiations. There are likewise supplication processions and exterior ornaments of divine praises, including resounding music, lighting candles and lamps, signs and the striking of bells, and the decorating of temples, altars, and likenesses. In all of this is required the highest and most special worship and beauty. For that reason, whatever is the most special, beautiful, and precious—gold, silver, precious stones, and the like—is used. Indeed, these venerations and outer consecrations are, as it were, instructions and invitations to spiritual sacred rites and obtain the favor of the gods, as Proserpina testified in these verses:

    However sacred rites of this kind are, as it were, a certain pact between the gods and us, and are exhibited under praises, veneration, or obedience, in the midst of which we often obtain some wonderful virtue from that divine power to whom is devoted such veneration. Thus are sacred hymns, sermons, exorcisms, incantations, and calls composed and dedicated to the praise and veneration of the gods. As Orpheus composed in the song

    The early church used certain sacred incantations against illnesses and storms, which all venerated under some divine power, either by pronouncing orations, whether written and hung from the neck or carried as an allegation.

    In this way, there are also sacred names, figures, characters, and seals, which contemplative men with a pure mind for their sacred vows have devoted, dedicated, and consecrated for the veneration of God. Indeed, if someone with the same purity of mind, later pronounces these [in the same way in which] it was originally instituted, they will make similar wonders. [To accomplish this,] they must also be reserved in the same manner and [follow the] rules [that were] handed down when [these rites were] first instituted; for those who are ignorant of these will ruin and frustrate their work.

    Similarly they conceived that certain material things have no small amount of sanctity and virtue from consecration, especially if priestly.

    Magicians command that these sacred and religious days be no less observed than planetary days and celestial dispositions, and moreover they regard them as much more effective, especially for acquiring spiritual and divine virtues, because those virtues and influences are not from the elements and celestial bodies but descend from the intelligences and supercelestial world, helped by the common assistance of the gods. [The observation of these sacred days] is not broken by any adverse disposition of the celestial bodies, nor frustrated by the contagion of the corruptible elements, as long as the magician in no way lacks a firm belief and religious veneration—that is, joined with fear and trembling.

    Whoever desires to labor in this faculty [of magic], must piously pray, entreating to the one God the Father that you can also be one and be made worthy of His mercy. Be clean on the inside and outside and in a clean place, because it is written in Leviticus: “Every man who approaches those things who is consecrated, in whom there is foulness, shall perish in the eyes of the Lord.”#t_footnote(<nt2977>, "nr2977")[1] Therefore, wash often and by the days decided according to the mysteries of number; dress yourself in clean garments and abstain from all foulness, pollution, and desire—indeed, the gods are unwilling to hear a man, as Porphyry said, who has not abstained for many days from venereal acts.#t_footnote(<nt2978>, "nr2978")[2] You must not touch a woman who is polluted or menstruating, nor one who suffers from bleeding,#t_footnote(<nt2979>, "nr2979")[3] nor touch the unclean, nor the dead.#t_footnote(<nt2980>, "nr2980")[4] 
As Porphyry said: “Those who touch the dead cannot be permitted to approach oracles,”#t_footnote(<nt2981>, "nr2981")[5] perhaps because they are corrupted by a certain affinity of a funerary odor, the mind becomes senseless in taking in divine influences. Wash, anoint, fumigate#t_footnote(<nt2982>, "nr2982")[6] yourself and offer sacrifice; indeed, God receives in the sweetest scent those [things] that are offered to him by a purified and well-disposed man. [His prayers will] likewise rise with that fumigation, oration, and their offering, thus the psalmist sang: “Let my prayer, Lord, be directed to you, as incense in your sight.”
  ]
  #p_normal[
    Furthermore, the soul—as the offspring and image of God— delights in these fumigations and scents, taking these in through the nostrils, through which they enter into the body of man and by which, as Job testified, the most lively spirits are sometimes sent out. The heart of a man is then unable to be restrained or boils with either wrath or effort. For this reason, many think that scents are the most lively and spiritual of all the senses.#t_footnote(<nt2983>, "nr2983")[7]

    In addition fumigations, sacrifices, and anointing penetrate everything, and opens the gates of the elements and heavens, that through them man can see and recognize the secrets of the Creator, heavenly things, that which is above the heavens, and that which descends from the heavens, as do angels, spirits of caves and the deep, and phantasms of abandoned places. These come, appear, become visible, and obey [by means of these rites]. All spirits are peaceful and are attracted like a magnet to iron [when these things are done] and join with the elements. [These rites] make spirits take bodies. Accordingly, the spiritual body is very much condensed by them and is thickened; and indeed, it lives by the scents of vapors, fumigations, and libations.#t_footnote(<nt2984>, "nr2984")[8]

    In whatever you work, do it full of affection and with a longing heart, that all of the heavens and celestial bodies will favor you.

    Indeed, a fortunate place can confer much for favor.

    Indeed, astrologers teach that the times can bring a certain fortune for our events, which magicians [also] observe. Finally, all ancient wise men agree that each moment of time and the disposition of the heavens is of extremely great interest. These [effects apply] to not just natural things but also to artificial things that have received its being in this world. Indeed, they have related that this initial moment [of inception] has such a great power, that the entire course of fortune depends on it. It can be predicted, and for an equal reason the fortune following that initial moment can be searched for backward [in time],#t_footnote(<nt2991>, "nr2991")[15] 
which they firmly believe and profess by experience to have witnessed, just as 
when Caligula consulted Sulla the astrologer, he predicted [Caligula’s] most certain approaching death.#t_footnote(<nt2992>, "nr2992")[16] The astrologer Metheon, predicted the calamity of the future war, [foretelling] the Athenians making a march on Syracuse. When Meson the astrologer was about to sail to Sicily, he predicted a storm. From the knowledge of these times, Anaxagoras forewarned which day a stone would fall from the Sun, as happened later at the Aigos,#t_footnote(<nt2993>, "nr2993")[17] a river in Thrace. On the contrary, L. Tarucius Firmianus found the conception and birth of Romulus from his deeds and fortunes. The same man found the day of birth for the city of Rome from notable fortunate successes. Maternus referred to the beginning or birth of the world#t_footnote(<nt2994>, "nr2994")[18] from which the events of things can be learned.#t_footnote(<nt2995>, "nr2995")[19]

    It can be shown in many examples how times can do much in natural things, inasmuch as there are trees that invert their leaves after the solstice, such as the poplar, elm, olive, lime, and white willow.#t_footnote(<nt2996>, "nr2996")[20] Shellfish, crabs, and oysters grow with the waxing Moon and become thinner with its waning, and the ebbing and flowing of the sea observes the motion and times of the Moon.#t_footnote(<nt2997>, "nr2997")[21] And does not Euripus in Euboea#t_footnote(<nt2998>, "nr2998")[22] ebb and flow at a wonderful speed?#t_footnote(<nt2999>, "nr2999")[23] Likewise, the Moon stands still for three days each month—namely, the seventh, eighth, and ninth. Among the Troglodytes, there is a lake that three times a day is made bitter and salty and again becomes sweet.#t_footnote(<nt3000>, "nr3000")[24] In wintry days when everything is withered, the dry pennyroyal flourishes,#t_footnote(<nt3001>, "nr3001")[25] and they say that on the same day when inflated bladders break, the willow leaves and pomegranate seeds turn and revolve. It is undoubted (and I have seen it myself and learned of sowing in Italy and France) that a nut tree may be dry for the entire year until the eve of St. John’s day, when leaves, flowers, and ripe fruits are produced. This wonder entirely consists of only the time observed in its sowing.

    That times can produce some wonderful virtue in artificial things, is constantly affirmed by astrologers in their books on elections and images. For this reason, we read from Plutarch of a likeness among the Pellenians that was built with an art that [created a wondrous effect:] wherever it looked in any direction it caused terror and great disturbances. Thus no one would dare gaze upon it without fear.#t_footnote(<nt3002>, "nr3002")[26] And in the 
#emph[Life of Apollonius,] we read that Babylonian magicians tied four golden birds to the roof, which were called the tongues of the gods, and they had the power to unite the minds of the multitude to the love and obedience of the king.#t_footnote(<nt3003>, "nr3003")[27] On the island of Chios, there was the face of Diana placed high, whose face seemed sad to those entering but cheerful to those leaving.#t_footnote(<nt3004>, "nr3004")[28] Among the Trojans, sacrifices left around the likeness of Minerva did not putrefy. In the sanctuary of Venus at Paphos, it never rained in that area. If something was taken from the tomb of Antaeus, rains scattered from the heavens until that thing was dug out and retrieved. In the tomb of King Bibria of Pontus there were laurels displayed, which if someone brought some of these onto a ship, quarrels did not cease until they were discarded. In the island of Borysthenes, no birds infested the temple of Achilles. No flies or dogs entered into the Roman temple of Hercules in the ox market. In Olynthus in Thrace, there was a place, in which if a beetle happened to fall, they could not escape, but twisted about and died.#t_footnote(<nt3005>, "nr3005")[29] I could give almost innumerable examples even more wonderful than these, which ancients told of the arts of images and observations of times to be made.

    But so that no one should believe them less and consider [these wonders] as trifles and something that became obsolete long ago, there are some more recent things that can be seen in this time in several places, and I will add some artificial wonders. They say that with the art of making images at Byzantium no serpent can strike, and jackdaws would not fly within the walls; that in Crete there are no owls; that in the Neapolitan fields cicadas cannot be heard;#t_footnote(<nt3006>, "nr3006")[30] that in Venice no flies enter the public houses of barbers; that in Toledo in the public market not more than one fly with a conspicuous white color can be seen for an entire year. In the preceding book we have spoken of manners and times, which (if observed) render these and similar things possible.

    In addition, you must especially observe the power of sermons and words; indeed, through these, the soul expands into inferior natures, stones, metals, plants, animals, and all natural things, impressing figures and various passions into them, giving strength to all creatures or leading and drawing by a certain love. Thus, Cato testified that tired oxen are refreshed by words,#t_footnote(<nt3007>, "nr3007")[31] then with words and prayers Tellus#t_footnote(<nt3008>, "nr3008")[32] can be reached so that she can cherish trees, and likewise, those trees can be persuaded to move to another place and grow only there. Likewise, turnips grow larger if they are entreated to while sown, that they would graciously contribute to the family and neighbors. Likewise, if a peacock is praised, they will soon unfold their feathers;#t_footnote(<nt3009>, "nr3009")[33] 
however, on the contrary, it is known that when the herb basil is sown with 
great cursing and disgrace, it brings fruit and is happy. Also, #emph[garus]#t_footnote(<nt3010>, "nr3010")[34] being poured onto burns and wounds heals, but only if the name of 
#emph[garus] is not mentioned.#t_footnote(<nt3011>, "nr3011")[35] Those who bewitch can kill trees by calling upon them, and they harm crops and children.#t_footnote(<nt3012>, "nr3012")[36]

    In addition, they say that there is such a great power in human imprecations that evil daemons can be expelled and banished. For this reason, Eusebius reported that Serapis among the Egyptians produced symbols that expelled daemons, and he also taught that daemons assumed the figures of brutes so that they can ambush men.#t_footnote(<nt3013>, "nr3013")[37]

    Finally, have God before your eyes in everything [you do]; indeed, it was written in Deuteronomy: “When you search for the Lord God, you will find Him if you search with your whole heart and the entire tribulation of your soul.”#t_footnote(<nt3014>, "nr3014")[38] But by truthful and constant faith you can please God and all the daemons;#t_footnote(<nt3015>, "nr3015")[39] of which we read in Mark: “Everything, whatever you desire when you pray, believe that you will receive it, and it will come to you.”#t_footnote(<nt3016>, "nr3016")[40] It said from Matthew: “If you have faith as a mustard grain, nothing will be impossible for you.”#t_footnote(<nt3017>, "nr3017")[41]

    Likewise, constant prayer from the just will prevail over much: “Indeed, Elijah, as James said, is a man like us susceptible to passions and with prayer he prayed that it does not rain over the earth and it did not rain for three years and six months; and again he prayed and the heavens gave rain and the earth gave its fruit.”#t_footnote(<nt3018>, "nr3018")[42] But beware that you do not pray for some vain desire or something that is against divine will. God wills everything that is good. “Do not take the name of God in vain, because He will not allow those who use His name for a vain thing to go unpunished.”#t_footnote(<nt3019>, "nr3019")[43] Be abstinent and give alms, because as the angel said to Tobias: “Prayer is good with fasting and alms.”#t_footnote(<nt3020>, "nr3020")[44] We read in the book of Judith: “Know that the Lord will hear your prayers, you remain fasting and pray in the gaze of the Lord.”#t_footnote(<nt3021>, "nr3021")[45]

    In this book, we have compiled the traditions of the ancients from diverse collections for an introduction into magic. Indeed, this has been done in a few short speeches, but well enough for those who are intelligent.#t_footnote(<nt3022>, "nr3022")[1] Some of these are written in order, some out of order, some delivered in fragments, some hidden and must be left for the intelligent to investigate, who can more acutely examine what is written and can likewise search for the complete documents of magical arts and can consequently infallibly experiment with them. Indeed, we have delivered these arts in such a way that they cannot happen to be hidden from the prudent and intelligent.#t_footnote(<nt3023>, "nr3023")[2] However, the mysteries of these secrets cannot be admitted to the crooked and nonbeliever, as they will leave them in a stupor, destitute under the shadow of ignorance and desperation.

    Therefore, you, sons of learning and wisdom: search in this book, collecting our dispersed intentions that we have displayed in diverse places because what is hidden in one place, we will make plain in another, as the wisdom is revealed to you.#t_footnote(<nt3024>, "nr3024")[3] Indeed, we have only written this for you, whose mind is uncorrupted, instituted toward a right order of living, who with a chaste and pure mind with an unimpaired faith, fear, and reverence of God, whose hands are untouched by wickedness and blame, and with virtuous morals, sober, and a modest [manner]. Indeed, you alone will discover this learning that is protected for you and uncover secrets with many hidden puzzles, which cannot be elicited without an understanding of the secrets. You will understand them when the entire impregnable science of magic insinuates itself into you, and those virtues will appear to you, just as Hermes, Zoroaster, Apollonius, and other workers of wonders once obtained.

    But you, spiteful slanderers, sons of crooked ignorance and foolish wickedness: flee from us. Such people are the enemies [of those whom I call sons of learning and wisdom]. [You, the slanderers,] are placed on a precipice, so that you may err and fall into misery. Therefore, if those who, because of their disbelief and lazy intellect, do not obtain their desire, do not ascribe the guilt of your ignorance to me, nor say that I erred or wrote with a false intention or lied. Those who do not understand our writings would accuse themselves;#t_footnote(<nt3025>, "nr3025")[4] indeed, [our writings] are obscure and are covered with various mysteries, in which many can easily err and lose their senses.
